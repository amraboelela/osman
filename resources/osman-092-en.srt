Come on, my lions.

00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,852
Reward for our labors.

00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,691
We will get more.

00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:58,076
Get the catapults.

11
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:00,568
Collect the coins.

Close to everything.

Blacksmith davut bey.

20
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,734
So much preparation.

21
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,734
Did you do it for me?.

22
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:05,438
I'm honored.

23
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,004
These are catapults.

I burned them all.

What will you do now?.

29
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:25,951

Here his name is turk.

With the light of islam in our hearts.

38
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:54,743
From where it burned.

Approx.

43
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:21,289
You will also have plenty of fire in the hereafter.

44
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:25,262
I don't like stories, demirci bey.

45
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,037
But you turks.

46
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,000
You love the story.

47
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:33,423
You talk too much.

The monopoly is gone.

51
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,558
Bilecik is gone.

52
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:13,677
Tekfur basileus will go to yarhisar.

53
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:14,915
In inegol.

54
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:18,394
I don't think so, commander.

55
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,330
What can stop the turks?

56
00:07:25,497 --> 00:07:26,953
Sieges.

57
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:30,000
Will never happen.

58
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:33,370
Because they will lose everything they have.

59
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:38,239
And they will not succeed.

60
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:43,812
They're doing something, mr.

61
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:45,425
They will make a move.

62
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,902
You say he looked very confident, huh?

63
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,203
How and where will they know?

Sir.

66
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:03,128
Smash aktemur a little.

67
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:05,887
Then take it to your tent.

68
00:08:07,516 --> 00:08:08,661
Command.

69
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,384

I'm fine, sir.

83
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,606
You go after that dog.

84
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:34,744
Master davut, i will not put you alone.

00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:35,811
Brother, i'm here.

86
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:36,311
Come on.

87
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,930
These scars do nothing to me.

88
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:40,281
Go after that dog, mr.

89
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:42,305
Come on bro.

90
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:42,878

Come on guys.

94
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:14,170
Let's go immediately.

Samil.

96
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,377
We'll go after my bey.

[music is playing].

98
00:10:33,587 --> 00:11:44,454

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,350
Deh.

102

[music is playing].

103
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,444
Nicholas.

[music is playing].

105
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:35,111
Nicholas.

106
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:37,559
Sir.

[music is playing].

108
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:43,281
Bring this after me.

109
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,531
It's your command, sir.

110
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:45,586
It's your command, sir.

111

[music is playing].

112
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:55,289
Sir, he shot the big prey.

113
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:57,852
If nikola fell into our hands.

114
00:13:57,852 --> 00:13:59,827
Know that the fall of inegÃ¶l is also near.

115
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:02,787
Tekfur nikola.

116
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:05,565
His oppression and sufferings were spoken like this.

117
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:08,247
It looks small.

118
00:14:09,784 --> 00:14:11,395
But it is nauseating.

119
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,032
Nikola's loss to us is no less.

120
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,027
Order waits, come on.

00:14:17,027 --> 00:14:29,248
[music is playing].

122
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:39,105
[music is playing].

123
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:41,377
Brother is nice to them.

124
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:42,435
We were working hard.

125
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:45,000
It's all gone, all of it.

126
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,335
The place of the burned ones will be filled, my brother.

127
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:50,994
Push it off nikola.

128
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:52,516
If i don't see it burn like this.

129
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,763
I don't get cold.

130
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:57,980
Thank you, friend.

131
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,417
Thanks.

00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:24,220
[music is playing].

133
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,381
Nicholas.

134
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:27,830
Did he run away or osman bey?

135
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:31,584
It is in our hands.

136
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,842
Next to the alps.

137
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,057
He will come to the camp with us.

138
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,673
Why are we taking him, osman bey?

139
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,584
You would hit your neck.

140
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,000
If we would have crossed that dog.

141
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,820
He needs me alive.

142
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:49,689
When you take inegol castle.

143
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,122
I will release him.

144
00:15:56,534 --> 00:15:58,379
Shall we bargain for conquest?

145
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:04,394
That bastard, our brothers.

146
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:05,228
After what they did.

147
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:06,533
It is not befitting of us to let it go.

148
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:10,009
Mr. osman.

149
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,389
Are we pursuing a blood feud, turgut bey?

150
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,025
We pursue a lawsuit.

151
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:21,071
[music is playing].

152
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:22,620
Inegol castle.

153
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,205
Spare a dog's life.

154
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,636
Is there anything better than taking it?

155
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:28,632
Just say it.

156
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,001
You say right.

157
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,305
First, inegol.

158
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:34,115
First, inegol.

159
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:54,615
[music is playing].

160
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,470
Sir, what if they don't accept?

161
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,180
[music is playing].

162
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,340
Then it belongs to turgut bey.

163
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,646
We will go the way he said.

164
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:07,535
[music is playing].

165
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:08,472
To go that route.

166
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:10,001
Do we have the power, osman bey?

167
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,945
[music is playing].

168
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,000
Everything has been razed to the ground.

169
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,782
[music is playing].

170
00:17:19,782 --> 00:17:21,627
How many martyrs do we have?

171
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:24,201
[music is playing].

172
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:26,046
They have been working for so many years.

173
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:28,500
For conquest.

174
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:31,415
They were beating pusat day and night.

175
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:39,893
[music is playing].

176
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,844
Bless all of their souls.

177
00:17:41,844 --> 00:17:42,844
Amine.

178
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:45,610
[music is playing].

179
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,066
Amine.

180
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,048
But.

181
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:52,838
But we will not waste their efforts.

182
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,332
We will not stop just because we got burned.

183
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:59,519
[music is playing].

184
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,830
We will attack completely first.

185
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,278
All together.

186
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:08,935
[music is playing].

187
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:09,914
My nephew.

188
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,221
You will go to inegÃ¶l.

189
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:15,126
[music is playing].

190
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:17,903
Like a captive commander in bilecik.

191
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,857
You will tell them

192
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,187
In response to nikola.

193
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:30,787
I would like inegol castle.

195
00:18:35,968 --> 00:18:37,579
It's your command, sir.

196
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:47,194
[music is playing].

197
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,452
Bury our martyrs.

198
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:52,727
Where is davut usta?

199
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:53,779
It's ahead, sir.

200
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,397
Alps checking his wound.

201
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:57,819
Lets.

202
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:14,477
[music is playing].

203
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:43,665
[music is playing].

204
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:45,929
My valiant grandmother.

205
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,308
[music is playing].

206
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:52,295
My grandmother is with halime.

207
00:19:52,295 --> 00:19:54,318
My father used to tell us about ertuÄrul gazi.

208
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,428
Their love was so great.

209
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,000
Either.

210
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:02,835
Do they love each other very much?

211
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:04,584
A lot.

212
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,671
Selcan nene always told me.

213
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:08,910
Before we go to bed.

214
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:11,364
I am really curious.

215
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:13,811
I wish i could listen too.

216
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:16,999
My ata ertuÄrul has taken everyone against him.

217
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,430
For my halime nene.

218
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:21,434
He rescued her from the shroud and brought her to her father.

219
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,458
How is he not afraid of anyone?

220
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:28,195
Is he ever afraid of kayÄ±?.

221
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,000
My father is ertugrul.

222
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,007
He was very warlike even when he was young.

223
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:34,925
Neither the inner enemy has been defeated.

224
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,133
Nor outside.

225
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,959
My nene halime also fell in love with him.

226
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:42,887
Hey.

227
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:46,258
My ata ertuÄrul went to gazelle hunting.

228
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:47,962
Halime fell in love with my grandmother.

229
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,916
My halime nene too.

230
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:53,998
He stood by her until the end of his life.

231
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:58,151
What a great love.

232
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:12,195
[music is playing].

233
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:13,807
You're also from my selcan nene.

234
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:15,885
You would have heard their love, holofira.

235
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:19,980
[music is playing].

236
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,669
He used to say very differently.

237
00:21:23,874 --> 00:21:25,252
My valiant grandmother.

238
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:28,882
[music is playing].

239
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:30,000
My valiants.

240
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:34,264
My valiants.

241
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,709
Osman bey has returned to the camp.

242
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:39,197
And it turned like that.

243
00:21:39,393 --> 00:21:41,393
That nikola captured his dog.

244
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:45,387
Who could stand against my father?

245
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:49,859
Nikola's account will be tough.

246
00:21:50,463 --> 00:21:51,453
Come on then.

247
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:52,535
Let's get there quickly.

248
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:53,553
Lets.

249
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:47,920
[music is playing].

250
00:22:47,920 --> 00:23:37,227
[music is playing].

251
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,616
Davut usta has a wound.

252
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:42,453
Take him to the hospital with alpar, auburn abdal.

253
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:59,328
[music is playing].

254
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:07,351
Inegol castle.

255
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:19,046
[music is playing].

256
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,176
Stop.

257
00:24:20,176 --> 00:24:20,800
Who are you?.

258
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:24,113
It's about tekfur nikola.

259
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:25,556
I have things to tell.

260
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:26,605
What will you tell?

261
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:27,685
Who sent you?

262
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:32,149
I am one of the commanders taken prisoner in bilecik.

263
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:35,349
Osman also took tekfur nikola prisoner.

264
00:24:36,954 --> 00:24:38,488
He sent me to bargain.

265
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:40,858
I need to speak to a highranking commander.

266
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,808
What? how come?.

267
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:44,538
Come with me.

268
00:24:44,538 --> 00:24:47,485
[music is playing].

269
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,941
What happened to nikola?

270
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,650
Headquarters.

271
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:53,690
Was he able to disperse the headquarters?

272
00:24:54,718 --> 00:24:56,718
Are you the highest ranking commander?

273
00:24:56,718 --> 00:25:02,879
[music is playing].

274
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,179
Who is asking?

275
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:09,846
[music is playing].

276
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,846
Here is the greatest commander.

277
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:14,963
[music is playing].

278
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:16,963
Not just inegÃ¶l.

279
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,414
The greatest commander of rome.

280
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:23,114
[music is playing].

281
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:25,516
I don't like compliments, arius.

282
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,419
The only thing that encourages me.

283
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:32,029
The agonizing cries of the people i've killed.

284
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:37,698
[music is playing].

285
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:38,843
Who are you?.

286
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:40,125
I.

287
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,849
Alexander, one of the commanders captured by osman.

288
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,578
Alexander.

289
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:52,210
The commanders of the great rome.

290
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,937
Since when has he been captured?

291
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:56,634
Instead of dying.

292
00:25:56,634 --> 00:26:18,966
[music is playing].

293
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:21,305
You are talented young commander.

294
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:23,879
It's good that you're not dead.

295
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,425
To explain.

296
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:32,338
Nicholas.

297
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,312
He destroyed the headquarters.

298
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,679
But osman caught him.

299
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,276
Now in their hands, injured.

300
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:41,824
Osman wants to bargain with you.

301
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:43,194
That's why he sent me.

302
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,175
Osman.

303
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,931
Why did he send you?

304
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:55,681
Why did he trust you?

305
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:58,457
You were released from captivity.

306
00:27:00,066 --> 00:27:02,066
You could have easily run away.

307
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:03,427
He?.

308
00:27:03,427 --> 00:27:07,678
[music is playing].

309
00:27:07,678 --> 00:27:08,745
A turkish.

310
00:27:08,745 --> 00:27:10,454
Does he trust us, sir?

311
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:13,567
Osman did not trust me.

312
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:16,146
Forced it.

313
00:27:18,494 --> 00:27:20,649
If i hadn't come, he would have killed my soldiers.

314
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,892
How much is alexander.

315
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:27,265
A loyal commander to his soldiers.

316
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:32,345
Are you loyal to your soldiers too, romanos?

317
00:27:33,775 --> 00:27:36,319
Commanders are not loyal to their soldiers.

318
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:40,402
Soldiers are loyal to their commanders.

319
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:43,432
Because leaders win wars.

320
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:45,000
Not soldiers.

321
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,313
What does osman want in return for nikola?

322
00:27:58,228 --> 00:28:01,238
Aya nikola for inegol castle.

323
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:04,265
If you surrender the castle.

324
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,899
My soldiers and nikola.

325
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,234
He said he would release it.

326
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:15,739
[music is playing].

327
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:17,506
Bilecik first.

328
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,354
Now inegol.

329
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:25,613
Your language is always.

330
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:27,937
Says bad things, alexander.

331
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:32,247
I guess i'll have to cut it off.

332
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:36,428
Don't feel the anger of defeat.

333
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:38,216
No sense, romanos.

334
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:42,181
Nikola's capture was not in vain.

335
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:44,641
Our goal was to disperse that headquarters.

336
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Nikola did it too.

337
00:28:47,656 --> 00:28:49,967
Do you think this will stop osman?

338
00:28:51,552 --> 00:28:52,775
It won't be enough.

339
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,775
He will reestablish the headquarters.

340
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:56,254
Mine tomorrow.

341
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:58,436
Maybe if i didn't get it.

342
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,969
But without the metal.

343
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:03,944
Osman won't be able to do anything.

344
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,352
It's nicholas.

345
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:08,831
Shall we leave it in osman's hands?

346
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,853
I can not allow this.

347
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:13,663
We're going to give this proposition some thought.

348
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:16,694
You can be our guest in the castle.

349
00:29:17,913 --> 00:29:19,136
I'm grateful, sir.

350
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:21,392
I hope my soldiers and tekfur nikola.

351
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,876
You will find a way to save.

352
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:36,440
[music is playing].

353
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,208
We will not consider this offer.

354
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:42,681
Ä°negÃ¶l will never be osman's.

355
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,366
No soldiers.

356
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:50,033
It is not worth more than the land of rome.

357
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,685
My most adept student.

358
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:55,918
I will not leave it in osman's hands.

359
00:29:56,887 --> 00:29:58,887
I already installed my game.

360
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:00,737
Trust your master.

361
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:03,295
You are not my master.

362
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:06,495
I'm not your student either.

363
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:09,194
[music is playing].

364
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:11,194
I grew up drinking blood.

365
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:14,921
I walked in fires.

366
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,357
Whatever you're going to do now, hurry up.

367
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:22,662
Or go to constantinople.

368
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:24,009
I will raise an army.

369
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:25,785
And i will attack the turks.

370
00:30:25,785 --> 00:30:28,903
[music is playing].

371
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:30,514
In your anger.

372
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,997
To your army too.

373
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,378
No need, romanos.

374
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:39,238
Because barkin will save nikola.

375
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:44,193
[music is playing].

376
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:50,092
You can take this too.

377
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,483
But it will not die so easily.

378
00:30:54,483 --> 00:31:12,292
[music is playing].

379
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:14,073
Sons.

380
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:16,863
You can come.

381
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,156
You can come.

382
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:25,739
[music is playing].

383
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,195
My lions.

384
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:40,038
[music is playing].

385
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:41,727
We have martyrs.

386
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,505
But we have no grief.

387
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,795
That nikola bastard.

388
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:52,259
We made preparations for the conquest.

389
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:53,678
Raided the headquarters.

390
00:31:56,062 --> 00:31:58,217
Our alps drank the sherbet of martyrdom.

391
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:02,797
The valiant man's bone melts.

392
00:32:03,836 --> 00:32:05,681
But the name remains.

393
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:07,998
We them.

394
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:10,455
With their heroism.

395
00:32:10,858 --> 00:32:12,158
With their efforts.

396
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,593
And we will know by their warfare.

397
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:18,688
[music is playing].

398
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,465
We will commemorate them with the stones they set on the road to conquest.

399
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:24,315
[music is playing].

400
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:27,015
They have opened the way to conquest for us.

401
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:30,950
[music is playing].

402
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,561
We have nikola.

403
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,166
They either give the castle or take nikola.

404
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:40,162
Or take nikola's head.

405
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:43,396
They give the honor of conquering the castle.

406
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,841
The decision is theirs.

407
00:32:47,617 --> 00:32:48,840
The conquest is ours.

408
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:51,989
Allahu akbar.

409
00:32:52,378 --> 00:32:53,633
Allahu akbar.

410
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,412
Allahu akbar.

411
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:57,006
Allahu akbar.

412
00:32:57,395 --> 00:32:58,622
Allahu akbar.

413
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,094
Allahu akbar.

414
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:01,782
Allahu akbar.

415
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:03,498
Allahu akbar.

416
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:05,318
Allahu akbar.

417
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:06,866
Allahu akbar.

418
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:08,528
Allahu akbar.

419
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:10,176
Allahu akbar.

420
00:33:10,565 --> 00:33:11,692
Allahu akbar.

421
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:13,375
Allahu akbar.

422
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:17,675
How is kosses?

423
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:19,347
He is in the tent.

424
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:20,651
Waiting for you.

425
00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:28,212
Allahu akbar.

426
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:30,462
You'll be fine, big david.

427
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:31,585
You will be fine.

428
00:33:32,645 --> 00:33:34,023
Your wound will heal.

429
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,846
Catapults burned.

430
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:42,346
And the bastard who opened the wound.

431
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:44,084
They brought master david.

432
00:33:44,084 --> 00:33:45,641
Ah.

433
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:48,677
My hospital friend david.

434
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:51,271
Aren't you dead yet?

435
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:58,230
You're breathing because my lord said so, nikola.

436
00:33:58,231 --> 00:33:59,609
Don't play with my anger.

437
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:02,748
Brown abdal.

438
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:05,204
Osman bey wanted him to live for now.

439
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:13,098
To die or to live.

440
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:15,391
It is from allah.

441
00:34:16,394 --> 00:34:17,928
It's my duty.

442
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,747
To cause healing.

443
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,925
Injured though.

444
00:34:23,925 --> 00:34:26,684
The hands of the person whose chin is working do not rest comfortably either.

445
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:28,668
Let's chain it up.

446
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,666
Do not be afraid if nikola draws his sword.

447
00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:35,242
But if he speaks, be afraid.

448
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,075
That's what a dog like this deserves.

449
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:42,776
Since you still haven't killed me.

450
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:46,548
It means all of you to me.

451
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:49,176
You are in need.

452
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:51,503
Your reign is over now, nikola.

453
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:52,908
Shut up.

454
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:08,444
Osman's loyal dogs.

455
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:10,581
Mr. ganja.

456
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:13,038
Put a cloth in your mouth.

457
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:24,608
Don't worry about your hand.

458
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:39,666
[music is playing].

459
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:40,573
Well.

460
00:35:40,911 --> 00:35:43,533
Well, let it be as you say.

461
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:45,873
I will stay away from this war.

462
00:35:45,873 --> 00:35:46,748
But still to you.

463
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,498
I want to help out.

464
00:35:48,498 --> 00:35:50,171
Thank you, kosses.

465
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:51,315
Thanks.

466
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:52,783
But.

467
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:56,700
We will not do such imprudence.

468
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
I know, you've always been behind me.

469
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:02,234
You put your life on the line.

470
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:04,375
But.

471
00:36:05,154 --> 00:36:06,733
In the conquest of inegÃ¶l castle.

472
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:08,164
If you have one.

473
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:10,847
Emperor at that time.

474
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,890
Will impose heavy sanctions against you.

475
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:17,504
It will be found.

476
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:18,542
But so am i.

477
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:21,274
I'm not afraid at all, you know osman bey.

478
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:23,634
I know, kosses.

479
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:24,506
Of course i know.

480
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:26,446
But.

481
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:28,587
For now, you should hold back.

482
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,355
You prepare again.

483
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,639
We will fight with you more.

484
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,640
We will fight shoulder to shoulder.

485
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:38,539
Joyful.

486
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:42,105
For now, you must act like an enemy to me.

487
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:44,644
Well.

488
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:46,507
What do you want me to do?.

489
00:36:46,821 --> 00:36:47,888
Tell him.

490
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:49,559
Shall i form an army?

491
00:36:52,224 --> 00:36:53,214
Exchange rate.

492
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:55,967
But the emperor.

493
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:58,992
He'll think you're setting up that army against me.

494
00:37:02,172 --> 00:37:03,239
But you.

495
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,444
Raise an army to fight by my side.

496
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:10,128
Well.

497
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,570
Let's say you didn't.

498
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:15,397
They did not give up the castle.

499
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,954
Your catapults and pusats are damaged.

500
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:20,533
What will you do then?

501
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:22,725
My grandfather is suleyman shah.

502
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:25,115
Since my father ertuÄrul gazi.

503
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,681
We didn't let go of two things.

504
00:37:27,735 --> 00:37:28,802
One is a puss.

505
00:37:30,138 --> 00:37:31,516
The other is precaution.

506
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:36,903
We don't put all the radishes in the same basket.

507
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:39,727
The bigger one is still in the saddlebag.

508
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:42,825
Good, now i get it.

509
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,367
Looks like inegol walls are tomorrow.

510
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:47,116
Take a good beating, eh?

511
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,057
If you surrender with peace.

512
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:50,543
If they don't accept.

513
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:52,846
It will be like this.

514
00:37:52,846 --> 00:38:02,225
[music is playing].

515
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:03,603
Just say it.

516
00:38:05,668 --> 00:38:07,046
What is this state of you?

517
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:11,417
I don't know, osman bey.

518
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,757
But somehow.

519
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,711
Return to that dreary castle.

520
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:18,998
I don't feel like it at all.

521
00:38:20,947 --> 00:38:22,403
I do not know.

522
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:24,434
Maybe as much as before.

523
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:25,785
I'm not responsive, huh?

524
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,064
How should i know.

525
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:31,788
I think my soul is tired, osman bey, huh?

526
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:34,907
This is a series of betrayals.

527
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Losses after that.

528
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:44,471
I only saw that glow again for a moment.

529
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:48,531
When i'm hurt.

530
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:52,065
While praying on my literal head.

531
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:56,102
Maybe i didn't quite understand what you were saying.

532
00:38:57,663 --> 00:38:58,886
But it's like.

533
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,127
It was as if a spark flashed in my soul at that moment.

534
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:06,089
That glow, if only for a brief moment.

535
00:39:06,627 --> 00:39:08,472
I saw it again, osman bey.

536
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:12,460
Kosses.

537
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:16,046
This is the mercy of my lord.

538
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:18,356
And mercy.

539
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:22,348
While we're on our way to gas.

540
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,194
We burn with the same fire.

541
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:27,440
Read at your head.

542
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,899
If you felt them in prayer.

543
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:32,741
Especially when you invoke your lord.

544
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:34,141
Think about how you will feel.

545
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:40,684
[music is playing].

546
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:41,907
You're on the right track.

547
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:43,804
I hope my lord.

548
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:46,188
Not just in combat.

549
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:51,013
Keeps us on the same side in prayer.

550
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,745
[music is playing].

551
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:55,735
Thanks.

552
00:39:55,735 --> 00:39:59,716
[music is playing].

553
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:00,400
Thanks.

554
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:18,380
[music is playing].

555
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,980
Is there a destur, ayÅe hatun?

556
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:34,980
[music is playing].

557
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,820
Aktemur?.

558
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,300
Mother.

559
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:49,900
[music is playing].

560
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,420
Aktemur.

561
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,020
Aktemur.

562
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,780
My son.

563
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,760
My son.

564
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,300
O lord, thank you lord.

565
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,660
I saw my child through the eyes of the world.

566
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,260
Ay, ay, ay, ohh.

567
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,060
Let me see you.

568
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,020
Vuslat is close, mother.

569
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,020
But a little more patience is required.

570
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,140
I don't know son?

571

Mashaallah.

576
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,540

May my lord be your helper.

594
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,420
May you be victorious behind my osman bey.

595
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,620
Obana, go back to your mother, right?

596
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,860

00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,900
Thanks a lot, but.

605
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,900
What did i try to do with this?

606
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,100
You know too, my selvi.

607
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,820
All i think about.

608
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,500
It is the salvation of our tribe.

609
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,700
Of course i know.

610
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,860
But i know.

611
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,940
I haven't been able to sleep since we talked to you.

612
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,100
I was suffocating.

613
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,540
Barkin.

614
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,660
Osman bey and his obsession.

615
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,260
He was with us in our most difficult times.

616
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,580
Are your preparations complete, my selvi?

617
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,500
Didn't you say anything to anyone?

618
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,780
It's like you said, sir.

619
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,020
No one knows the way but me.

620
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,500
While leading the people, i will say the way.

621
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,020
When you reach the plateau.

622
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,900
Me from behind.

623
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,620
I will come with the rest of the people, insha'allah.

624
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,940
Insha'allah, sir.

625
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,900
I'll go and take care of the preparations.

[music is playing].

627
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,540
Is there a destur, sir?

628
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,340
Come, husamettin.

[music is playing].

630
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,740
The men are ready, they are waiting for news, mr.

631
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,820
You will be among those who go to the plateau.

632
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,460
Don't resist.

633
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,340
I don't want you to bleed.

634
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,100
It's your command, sir.

635
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,540
Husamettin.

636
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,620
Sir.

637
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,540
If a strand of selvi's hair is damaged.

638
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,380
I will kill you all.

[music is playing].

640
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,220
Sorrow and joy.

641
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,100
We are for humans.

642
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,180
Whatever comes, whatever happens, is from our lord.

643
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,980
We had our losses, our funerals.

644
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,300
We had martyrs.

645
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,180
Suction thank god.

646
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,580
All to their last breath.

647
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,580
Right on the way.

648
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:57,860
Selcan hatun.

649
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,100
Until the last moment of his life.

650
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,580
He worked tirelessly for the sake of justice.

651
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,540
May allah treat him with mercy.

652
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,220
Amine.

653
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,500
Amine. amine.

654
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,140
Selcan hatun too.

655
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,140
Sentence also our martyrs.

656
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,660
Let him be a neighbor to his messenger.

657
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,260
Amine.

658
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,700
Amen my sheikh.

659
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,220
Amine.

Our oba.

661
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,420
He grew up with the pain.

662
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,980
Us.

663
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,700
While we fight with the infidel with the pusat in one hand.

664
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,580
With our other hand.

665
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,820
We buried our martyrs.

666
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,420
It will always be like this.

667
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,140
We know well.

668
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,700
The only wish of the doubter.

669
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,460
The conquest for which they gave their lives.

670
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,940
It always continues.

671
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,460
I swear on the doubt.

672
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,220
God willing.

673
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,380
We will continue this case forever.

674
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,660
Amine.

675
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,900
Is there a destur, sir?

676
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,500
Come on aygul.

[music is playing].

678
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,220
Sir, the news from our scouts.

679
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,500
I wanted to give.

680
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,940
The convoy to take holofira is on its way.

681
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,780
Well, well.

682
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,380
Don't let your guard down.

683
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,660
Holofira is entrusted to us.

684
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,340
May you deliver it with greetings.

685
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,620
The eyes of the alps are on you, mr.

686
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,260
Thanks.

687
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,660
Thanks.

688
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,220
Aygul.

689
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,100
But we waited for you for iftar.

690
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,340
We know your condition.

691
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,660
We didn't want to touch.

692
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,340
I know.

693
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,380
Thank you, honey.

694
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,660
But the pain is very fresh.

695
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,700
Now i'm looking for him at iftar.

696
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,380
You will definitely experience the pain, my daughter.

697
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,140
Separation hurts your heart, i know.

698
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,100
Suck this separation.

699
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,740
It is not eternal.

700
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,860
The eternal home awaits us.

701
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,780
In this world where the messenger of allah lived for sixtythree years.

702
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,740
Death is not sad.

703
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,660
Always remember the dead.

704
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,020
Place in your heart with the qur'an and prayer.

705
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,940
You will keep it fresh.

706
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,740
When you meet in the hereafter.

707
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,820
There will be no separation.

708
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,140
Aydi, sit down late.

[music is playing].

711
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,420
We must take special precautions on the way back.

712
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,580
I don't want a mistake.

713
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,060
Now rest well.

714
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,860
No one will blink after taking holofira.

715
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,500
Don't worry, alexander.

716
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:12,340
We will reunite holofira with her rightful aunt.

[music is playing].

718
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,540
As you wished, we left no damage to your clothes, sir.

719
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,260
It's a pretty neat job, isaac.

720
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,660
I don't want a single mistake.

721
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,260
You will go to the kayi tribe.

722
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,260
And you will receive holofira.

723
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,860
No doubt, sir.

724
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,860
We memorized what you said one by one.

725
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:14,660
Beautiful.

726
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,100
So you came to yourself huh.

727
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,060
You are alive for now.

728
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:39,020
You will regret not killing me, osman bey.

729
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,660
Everything has its time.

730
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,940
Joyful.

731
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,860
You are a very smart man.

732
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,660
You will use me as leverage.

733
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,260
But in vain.

734
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,220
No one is for me.

735
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,100
Will not give you anything.

736
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,180
Especially inegÃ¶l.

737
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,940
You are inegÃ¶l.

738
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,780
Do you think you can get it in return for me?

739
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,300
Now is not the time to ask questions.

740
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,620
Now is the time to answer.

741
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,140
Let's see.

742
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,860
Who is that scoundrel you are dealing with?

743
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,500
You are asking about master aryus.

744
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,020
Only when his sword comes to your neck.

745
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,020
You will find out who you are.

746
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,260
Oh, by the way.

747
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,900
David.

748
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,540
Blacksmith david yes.

749
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,740
I hurt him badly.

750
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,900
It was so woeful.

751
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,500
He should be dead by now.

752
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,540
Master david lives.

753
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,820
It will be even better.

754
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,580
But you. you are alive, osman bey.

755
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,500
Let it live.

756
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,580
I have bought so many things from you.

757
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,340
I got your alps.

758
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,460
I took your women, your children.

759
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,500
I bought your loved ones.

760
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,580
I love you so much.

761
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,980
I took the prosecutor's brother.

762
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,700
I won't leave a single person around.

763
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,420
I will take them all.

764
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,300
What can you do to me?

765
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,820
Most.

766
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,180
You can take my life, osman bey.

767
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,020
Here you go.

768
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,740
Take my life

769
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,100
Is that so?.

770
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:12,700
You can't take anything from me.

771
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,660
Those who fell to the ground in the path of righteousness.

772
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,820
Nicholas will be rewarded with heaven.

773
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,940
You can't take anything from me.

774
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:32,140
Nothing can affect those who have a will of steel.

775
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,700
Your intention.

776
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,900
Playing with my nerves and getting yourself killed.

777
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,860
You say i will kill myself to save inegÃ¶l.

778
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,700
How dare you treat me.

779
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,460
Nor do i succumb to my anger.

780
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,460
Whether you die or live.

781
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,140
I will take inegÃ¶l.

782
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:27,860
Even if i die or stay, i will not give you inegÃ¶l.

783
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,500
Oh my beautiful mother.

784
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,980
She was the mother of all of us.

785
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,620
She was the mother of all this tribe.

786
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,580
He loved you too, holofira.

787
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,900
I loved him too.

788
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,660
You too.

789
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,340
I loved you all.

790
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,700
You are so different.

791
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,700
What are we different about?

792
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:06,620
Come on, just say.

793
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,820
Your everything.

794
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:16,540
Where you stay, where you sleep, later.

795
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,340
The stream in the camp, the tents.

796
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,020
No child feels like in a cage here.

797
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,180
My beautiful daughter.

798
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,780
You will not feel yourself in a cage anywhere else.

799
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,780
Since that castle is a dungeon for you.

800
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,620
You will not go there.

801
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:57,900
[music is playing].

802
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:20,460
[music is playing].

803
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,980
Come on aladdin.

804
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,940
Don't think so much.

805
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,300
Everything is in a hurry, brother.

806
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,580
You have little patience.

807
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,460
In order for me to make the right move, i have to think.

808
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,380
No, for the right move.

809
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,940
It is necessary to act in the first place.

810
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,060
In no time, you will take the breath of the enemy.

811
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:56,220
[music is playing].

812
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,180
What you said in cenkte is true, brother.

813
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,780
But hurry in this game.

814
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,460
It loses.

815
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,140
I'm new to you and see what made you lose.

816
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:13,540
[music is playing].

817
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,420
Aladdin?.

818
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:21,580
Will they play this game in iznik, bursa, konstantiniye?

819
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,340
I don't know.

820
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,180
But holofira knows.

821
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,780
Her aunt was there.

822
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,300
That's right, holofira knows.

823
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,860
How is the place to go, ace?.

824
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,980
Constantinople.

825
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,700
My brother.

826
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,940
One day i will go there too.

827
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:55,620
[music is playing].

828
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,380
It is not wise to attack from here.

829
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,980
Nice to hear.

830
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,380
Nicholas fortified its walls.

831
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,420
You are right, gunduz bey.

832
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,700
But to the inner castle.

833
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,380
That's the shortest way.

834
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,180
If we enter the war on the walls from one place.

835
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,260
We get stuck.

836
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,900
We lose a lot.

837
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:18,900
Mr gunduz.

838
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,500
What my turgut bey said is true.

839
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,620
Your loss comes first.

840
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,300
If necessary.

841
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,060
We throw stones at the walls and beat them for weeks.

842
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,060
But we do not know what awaits us inside.

843
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,820
I said it's not smart, konur.

844
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,620
I didn't say it wouldn't work.

845
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,780
Especially osman bey, let him come.

846
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,580
Let's see what he will say?

847
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,620
Destur.

848
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,740
Mr. osman.

849
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,900
Selamun aleykum.

850
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,100
Salam aleykum. salam aleykum.

851
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,960
We were in charge of the expedition.

852
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,520
Not with victory.

853
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,840
But praise be to my supreme lord.

854
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,800
Gave us victory.

855
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,240
Bilecik castle is ours.

856
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,264
And now.

857
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,680
Our target is inegÃ¶l castle.

858
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,600
Nicola is in our hands.

859
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,920
And he keeps the castle more than his life.

860
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,960
For the swap not to happen.

861
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,920
He will do everything he can.

862
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,040
We will besiege the castle.

863
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,920
We'll besiege the castle, sir.

864
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,000
We will also cut off the supply completely, evelallah.

865
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,640
However.

866
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,000
There are no catapults to beat the walls.

867
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,720
Nor the ram to break the door.

868
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,240
Sir.

869
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,240
This siege will be quite long and painful.

870
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,960
And your emperor.

871
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,120
And we will be exposed to the reinforcement of other tekfurs.

872
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,720
Of course, we will block the support paths.

873
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,920
But if they come to allout war.

874
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,480
Whatever we do, we stay in the open.

875
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,560
It will be as you say.

876
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,120
We're going to close the fort's supply lines.

877
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:43,820
And.

878
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,744
To all four sides.

879
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,160
We'll put the watchers.

880
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,800
And a single supplement from the outside.

881
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,824
It will not reach inegÃ¶l.

882
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,520
We will do all of this in a very short time.

883
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,360
One day this will be over.

884
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,360
The headquarters they burned and destroyed.

885
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,520
It was the place where catapults and pusats were made.

886
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,240
But it's not where it is.

887
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,000
Their ammunition.

888
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,960
Hiding it with cerkutay's trade.

889
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,540
We took it to the farthest corners of inegÃ¶l.

890
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,320
Here are the stairs.

891
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,200
Here are the catapults.

892
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,640
There is also a ram here.

893
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:51,600
Well.

894
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,680
The war had been in inegÃ¶l for years.

895
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:58,320
But they didn't know anything.

896
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,560
May you forgive us, osman bey.

897
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,600
But when would we know about them?

898
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,760
The secret is a burden, turgut bey.

899
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,784
It's a load.

900
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,400
But.

901
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,440
You should not think that i do not trust you.

902
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,080
I was able to carry.

903
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:22,900
I carried it.

904
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:23,760
Thanks.

905
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,680
Now you have news.

906
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,600
There is more.

907
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,280
David master.

908
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,560
He used to work on the blooming roses of akÃ§a shepherd.

909
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,584
Muaffak was born.

910
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,720
And we placed them around inegÃ¶l.

911
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,480
Nice people were busy, old man.

912
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,040
He finished just in time.

913
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,600
Just in time.

914
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Now they are.

915
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,200
We are ready to besiege.

916
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,920
They know we don't have a catapult to destroy it.

917
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,480
When you see us in front of the walls.

918
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,504
Woe to you osman bey.

919
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,680
Hey.

920
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:06,880
Hey bro.

921
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,040
Roll up the catapults.

922
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,240
It's up to you to start the siege.

923
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,400
You're on the road fast.

924
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,480
As davut usta said.

925
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,520
The walls of inegol tomorrow.

926
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,160
We're going to start banging.

927
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,920
Hopefully.

928
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:29,880
I hope mr.

929
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,040
It is the time of conquest.

930
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,600
Shafi.

931
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,840
Showers of mercy.

932
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,120
Kosses are also rain for your servant.

933
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,640
Heal him.

934
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,480
Your apostle.

935
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,360
For the sake of muhammed mustafa's face water.

936
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:18,920
For the sake of the water of the face of jesus, who is the kelimullah.

937
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,480
Heal the wounds of this wounded servant.

938
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,320
Him.

939
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,680
Heal, lord.

940
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:50,260
[azan voice].

941
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
Allahu akbar.

942
01:05:52,744 --> 01:06:06,380
[azan voice].

943
01:06:06,404 --> 01:06:50,660
[music is playing].

944
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:51,680
Mr. osman.

945
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,680
Hey, what happened to mr. barkÄ±n?

946
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,400
The situation is not good at all.

947
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,960
My selvi, my obali.

948
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,984
All are in danger.

949
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,120
Help me.

950
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,400
I fell into the furnace.

951
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,600
Who did this?

952
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,600
The dog called romanos.

953
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,240
My obÃ¢l, selvi, who went to the plateau.

954
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,680
Captured them all.

955
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,040
In return.

956
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,080
In return, he asks for nicola.

957
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,560
But it's not just nicola.

958
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,800
He also wants the soldiers you captured in bilecik castle.

959
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,040
If we don't set them free.

960
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,000
He threatens to kill everyone he captures.

961
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,080
For god's sake.

962
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,104
Help me osman bey.

963
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,760
If something happens to my people or selvi.

964
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,160
Don't worry, mr. barkÄ±n.

965
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,000
Who did we follow up to this time?

966
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:48,560
But.

967
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,000
Would go to the plateau in secret.

968
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,600
Who told the route?

969
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:02,720
We have no choice but to save nicola, barkÄ±n.

970
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:05,000
On the way to the highland.

971
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:08,660
We will take selvi and the people of the tribe captive.

972
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,160
In response to nicola.

973
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:10,684
Impossible.

974
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,960
I wouldn't involve selvi in this.

975
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,480
Get what you want from obalÄ±.

976
01:08:17,504 --> 01:08:19,020
But not selvi.

977
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,420
Barkin.

978
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:22,880
Don't be afraid, it's just a game.

979
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,480
I promise you.

980
01:08:25,504 --> 01:08:27,720
Even cypress' hair will not be harmed.

981
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,160
As we talked, osman bey.

982
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:34,640
I didn't give anyone the route.

983
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,240
They obviously knew the way out beforehand.

984
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:43,600
We'll find out who said it later.

985
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,624
But.

986
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,160
Let's think about what to do first.

987
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:50,920
Barkin.

988
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,520
Barkin.

989
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,680
Where is cypress?.

990
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:57,400
What will happen, osman bey? is what i heard true?

991
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,320
It is true, malhun hatun.

992
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,960
But we will save selvi's hair before it gets damaged.

993
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,680
Isn't it, osman bey?

994
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:13,280
We will not put my sister in the hands of these oppressors, will we, osman?

995
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,540
Malhun.

996
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:16,960
Do not be afraid.

997
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,320
We will save selvi safely.

998
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,640
Who are we after, aren't we, sir?

999
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:28,600
Like that.

1000
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:33,000
We will not put cypress in their hands.

1001
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:42,620
[music is playing].

1002
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:49,160
Look at the smell.

1003
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:51,840
Smells like stink.

1004
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,040
Disgusting shepherd's tent.

1005
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,064
Disgusting.

1006
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,840
Thank god i didn't put you to bed in snakes.

1007
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,560
Now you will go to your castle.

1008
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,000
My pen?

1009
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,320
Will you send?

1010
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,200
Joyful?.

1011
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,280
Mr. osman.

1012
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,920
To change your mind.

1013
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,560
What caused osman bey?

1014
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,080
Judging by his serenity.

1015
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,080
You didn't get what you wanted.

1016
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,920
I wasn't going to stay any longer in your evil tent anyway.

1017
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,160
I was going to pull away.

1018
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,000
What good.

1019
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,880
But you know this.

1020
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,440
In his comfortable bed in that castle.

1021
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,000
I will not make you sleep.

1022
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,440
You will be so afraid.

1023
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:16,640
When will you wait for me to come and get your head?

1024
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,560
He won't even be able to sleep.

1025
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,000
Ha.

1026
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,500
Solve it.

1027
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:37,940
Ah.

1028
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,040
Barbarian shepherds.

1029
01:11:43,180 --> 01:12:09,065
[music is playing].

1030
01:12:09,065 --> 01:12:09,980
Traitor.

1031
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,300
Traitor.

1032
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,000
We want justice.

1033
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,840
We want justice.

1034
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:32,960
Bastard.

1035
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:35,720
Get his head.

1036
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,480
We want justice.

1037
01:12:56,964 --> 01:12:58,220
O people.

1038
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,960
To kill this bastard.

1039
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,400
I would like most.

1040
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:21,940
But.

1041
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,960
Selvi hatun.

1042
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,520
And took the people of barkÄ±n bey as captives.

1043
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,360
If the.

1044
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,600
Because of this dog.

1045
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:43,320
If even the hair of the people there is harmed.

1046
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,840
I am not accountable to my conscience.

1047
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:51,320
Now you say.

1048
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,600
Because of this infidel.

1049
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:59,520
If they slaughter those people.

1050
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,400
Will you be able to account for your conscience?

1051
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:07,160
Just say it.

1052
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,800
This bastard killed my son.

1053
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:18,120
It burned my lungs so much.

1054
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:20,144
But.

1055
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,168
You teach right.

1056
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:24,920
Do not let stones fall into the hearth of others.

1057
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,560
We wait for the time of revenge.

1058
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,040
Don't worry.

1059
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,240
Don't worry.

1060
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,280
It won't take long.

1061
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,440
I swear on the doubt.

1062
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:57,400
I will take nicola's life.

1063
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:03,800
But.

1064
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,560
Going to swap now.

1065
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:19,560
Mr. turgut.

1066
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,840
This important task is yours.

1067
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:29,320
The people of selvi hatun and barkÄ±n bey.

1068
01:15:29,344 --> 01:15:30,240
May you bring good luck.

1069
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:32,840
It's what you said, osman bey.

1070
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,760
We do not allow these dogs to play.

1071
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:38,080
Cut.

1072
01:15:38,104 --> 01:15:38,604
Sir.

1073
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:43,880
Also laughs.

1074
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:56,040
Even if the nails of your captives are not more valuable than you.

1075
01:15:56,064 --> 01:15:58,760
No force would have taken you out of this tribe alive.

1076
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,784
Lets.

1077
01:16:00,808 --> 01:16:31,660
[music is playing].

1078
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,640
Well, sir?

1079
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:36,040
What will happen now?

1080
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:38,720
What will we do?.

1081
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:40,744
We will not stop.

1082
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:43,240
If they play tricks on us.

1083
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,320
Then we will set up our game.

1084
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,720
Lets.

1085
01:16:51,744 --> 01:17:29,980
[music is playing].

1086
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:33,840
We will cut all the branches that osman clings to.

1087
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,320
Not a single living thing will come out of that mine alive.

1088
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:42,160
We're going to capture that mine first.

1089
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:44,360
Then too.

1090
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,360
We're going to blow up that mine.

1091
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,400
Are the flying paper clips ready?

1092
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:54,600
Everything is ready as you ordered, sir.

1093
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,624
Beautiful.

1094
01:17:58,340 --> 01:17:58,900
Beautiful.

1095
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,820
Come easy ladies.

1096
01:18:06,844 --> 01:18:07,580
Thank you ayÅe hatun.

1097
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,604
Oh my god.

1098
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:10,920
Oh my god.

1099
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:13,520
Come easy.

1100
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:16,440
Girls.

1101
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,600
The informal battle of inegÃ¶l has begun.

1102
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,440
From now on, we will work for the cenk.

1103
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,620
You will take a break from weaving rugs for a while.

1104
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:29,800
AyÅe hatun.

1105
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:33,040
The arrangement of the plazas is your responsibility.

1106
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,120
You girls will make shields and sharpen arrows.

1107
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,144
The ahis will also come to your aid.

1108
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,600
Don't be left behind, malhun.

1109
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:44,760
With the permission of allah, our alps will not lack anything.

1110
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:46,784
Thank you for this day.

1111
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:48,808
Tawny.

1112
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:52,040
You and the ladies will take care of the alps.

1113
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,240
We do not know how long his battle will last.

1114
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,580
That's why you should work with all your might.

1115
01:18:56,604 --> 01:18:58,120
The order is yours, malhun hatun.

1116
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:01,960
Brown abdal.

1117
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,920
What is the state of the hospital?

1118
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,920
Nearby tents of the hospital.

1119
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,080
We charged the injured alps.

1120
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,480
Alps prepare tents.

1121
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:16,480
Thank god.

1122
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,760
We also have enough herbs.

1123
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:21,784
We also have ointment.

1124
01:19:21,808 --> 01:19:22,360
Thank god.

1125
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:25,880
AydoÄdu and the women will be occupied by the injured alps.

1126
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,240
Girls.

1127
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:30,280
Go with kumral abdal and complete your supply.

1128
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:31,800
Don't miss a thing.

1129
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,920
It is the time of conquest.

1130
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:39,240
Our alps and our sisters are on the battlefield.

1131
01:19:39,264 --> 01:19:41,040
We will sweat here too.

1132
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,400
Lets.

1133
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,760
KayÄ± tribe awaits your service.

1134
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,080
Come on babes.

1135
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,000
Get up.

1136
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,520
Wait.

1137
01:19:59,200 --> 01:19:59,700
Don't bend.

1138
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,100
Fast.

1139
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:01,900
Horse.

1140
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:04,740
Get up.

1141
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,020
Wait.

1142
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:07,620
Don't bend.

1143
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:11,488
Get up.

1144
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,512
Wait.

1145
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,240
Don't bend.

1146
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:17,000
Horse.

1147
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:19,560
Get up.

1148
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,200
Wait.

1149
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:22,840
Don't bend.

1150
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:24,864
Horse.

1151
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:28,720
Get up.

1152
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,140
Wait.

1153
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,160
Don't bend.

1154
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,400
How is ahval, aygul?

1155
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,040
Thank god, bala.

1156
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,064
You worked well.

1157
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,640
It is clear that they have passed under discharge.

1158
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,520
My remaining sisters also help the women.

1159
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,280
The remaining lines need some more work.

1160
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:00,660
Good.

1161
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:04,200
Sisters.

1162
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:12,720
My brave ladies.

1163
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,160
In every battle you enter.

1164
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,440
You have proven your age.

1165
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,840
You didn't tilt my head forward.

1166
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,040
Be present.

1167
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,240
Aygul hatun.

1168
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:31,840
What do you think?.

1169
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,120
Are you ready for a new war, sisters?

1170
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,720
Even the nastiest chicks i've ever seen.

1171
01:21:38,744 --> 01:21:40,440
She is ready to be your sister.

1172
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:44,360
The arrow hits its target with the first shot.

1173
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,480
Masallah.

1174
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,504
Masallah.

1175
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:58,080
Sister.

1176
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,104
Three principles.

1177
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,128
What?.

1178
01:22:02,152 --> 01:22:05,080
Own your job, your age, your household.

1179
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:07,480
Oh my god.

1180
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,000
It's time to waste.

1181
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,024
It's time to fight.

1182
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:23,280
Our target is inegÃ¶l.

1183
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,360
On the walls of inegol.

1184
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:28,640
Until the kayi flags wave.

1185
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,800
It is not befitting for sisters to stand still.

1186
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:34,980
May our gaza be blessed.

1187
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:58,220
Allahu akbar.

1188
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:18,480
I will not take your life now.

1189
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,720
We have business with you.

1190
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,400
Mr. turgut.

1191
01:23:25,424 --> 01:23:27,040
Oh turgut bey.

1192
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:31,720
You were going to kill me when you caught me.

1193
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:34,520
But unfortunately.

1194
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,544
You couldn't.

1195
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:44,200
Why did you laugh?

1196
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,920
Is it a burden on your body?

1197
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:50,320
But let me say.

1198
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:54,360
He who laughs last laughs best.

1199
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:58,760
Cypress.

1200
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,160
Cypress i will save you.

1201
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,360
Keep it up, mr. barkin.

1202
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:05,840
We have come to take the prisoners safe and sound.

1203
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,560
The turks.

1204
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,440
I'm looking for an opportunity to kill you.

1205
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:18,960
Have a clean swap.

1206
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:23,840
Or.

1207
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,720
Prisoners first.

1208
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,400
Then i will kill you.

1209
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,200
If you growl at a turk like that again.

1210
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,224
I wear the rope around your neck.

1211
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,680
The swap will be clean of course.

1212
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,560
There is a saying you don't know.

1213
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,760
Our word is honor.

1214
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,000
My turgut bey says it is true.

1215
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,640
We want a clean swap too, romanos.

1216
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,800
Let the captives go now.

1217
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:59,080
Nicholas.

1218
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,104
Romanos

1219
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,240
You are still breathing.

1220
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,400
Well, i've had better days.

1221
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,600
I want to go back to the pen right now.

1222
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:10,624
For.

1223
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,040
I will finish the turks.

1224
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:17,860
[music is playing].

1225
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,240
What do you say in a hurry?

1226
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,040
But you are far from us.

1227
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,520
You will be close to azrael.

1228
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,840
You have numbered days.

1229
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:36,600
[music is playing].

1230
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,480

You know what to do.

1248
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,184
I don't want any mishaps.

1249
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:10,800
The black and white will emerge.

1250
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:11,840
Lets.

1251
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,440
May our gaza be blessed.

Amine. amine. amine.

01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:23,440
I'm sending the prisoners.

I was so scared, barkin.

1272
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,840
I was so scared.

1273
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:01,800
Passed.

1274
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,320

[music is playing].

1282
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:33,880
Where is vasilius?

1283
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:35,240
He died.

1284
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:37,720
The turks buried him.

1285
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:41,520
[music is playing].

1286
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,760
One more reason to burn their camp.

1287
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,060
But first the mines of ayyus.

1288
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,320
I'll wait for it to be destroyed.

Thanks.

1293
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:01,800
You may exist.

Are you okay?.

You survived again, nikola.

01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,080
You just survived.

1301
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:19,720
Seven is informal.

1302
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,744
It's almost time, turgut bey.

1303
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:23,200
Not long now.

1304
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,680
He will surely pay for the pain he inflicted.

1305
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:31,360
It's almost time, nikola.

1306
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:40,320
[music is playing].

1307
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,640
When you leave this place, you will have nothing left, osman.

1308
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,560
Let's attack.

1309
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,120
Kill them all.

01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:01,600
Trapped them all in eternal darkness.

01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,880
What is the end of the dogs that grind their teeth at us?

1313
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,480
Let's show now.

1314
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:14,960
Guards.

1315
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:16,984
You blow the caucasian wind.

1316
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:19,560
Let's remove those teeth one by one.

1317
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:22,120
My compass has run out of patience.

1318
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,740
Kefere is thirsty for his blood.

1319
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:27,440
Come on.

1320
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,240
Bride.

1321
01:30:31,520 --> 01:31:18,180
[music is playing].

1322
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:19,960
Where do you run to, huh?

1323
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:40,960
[music is playing].

1324
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,280
How would you know we are here?

1325
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:45,304
Where did you learn this?

1326
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,840
Coward dog.

1327
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,040
Don't be afraid to show your face, huh?

1328
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,680
Are you not afraid of my wrath?

1329
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:58,040
Ha?.

1330
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,600
Come here.

1331
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:22,960
[music is playing].

1332
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,120
You are in the guise of faqih.

1333
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,720
You came to my room.

1334
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,880
You sat at my table.

1335
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,540
You have been my guest.

1336
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,560
How did you catch me?

1337
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:39,200
How?.

1338
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:42,960
Joyful.

1339
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:53,300
[music is playing].

1340
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:54,400
Joyful.

1341
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:58,440
You are a devil disguised as a jurist.

1342
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,464
But me too.

1343
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,000
I created a wolf in human skin.

1344
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,600
[music is playing].

1345
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,720
Non.

1346
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,000
You are in my claw.

1347
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:28,680
[music is playing].

1348
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:30,280
It came from ak temur, my lord.

1349
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:47,680
[music is playing].

1350
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:49,860
Arius and the commander romanos.

1351
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,440
They were going to seize the mines and blow them up.

1352
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,760
By seizing our supply of ammunition.

1353
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,880
They want to prevent us from taking inegÃ¶l.

1354
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:06,880
Beautiful.

1355
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:08,904
Beautiful.

1356
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,400
Let them go.

1357
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:16,480
Let them come and see our wrath.

1358
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:20,740
[music is playing].

1359
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:23,000
You will be defeated by our darkness, osman.

1360
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:33,940
[music is playing].

1361
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:35,520
Joyful.

1362
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,080
You are a demon in disguise.

1363
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,280
You came to my obama.

1364
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,880
You ate my bite at my table.

1365
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,360
You tried to deceive us with the qur'an.

1366
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,880
Joyful.

1367
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,920
You've done good traitors.

1368
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:01,944
Joyful.

1369
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:04,200
Means.

1370
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,040
You were behind all this evil, huh?

1371
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:15,840
[music is playing].

1372
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:16,720
Come here.

1373
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:19,120
You tried to throw the willow on us, huh?

1374
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:21,520
Come.

1375
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,360
Mari.

1376
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:24,760
Umur bey.

1377
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,120
You would have killed ivaz bey, right?

1378
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:28,340
Ah.

1379
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,160
Come here.

1380
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,000
Means.

1381
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,600
You meant the life of sheikh edebalÄ±.

1382
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:36,720
Joyful.

1383
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,200
Educated.

1384
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,224
I killed him too.

1385
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,248
I also survived.

1386
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:46,240
If he's breathing right now, it's because of me.

1387
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:49,600
But admit it, osman.

1388
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:50,960
How did i play?

1389
01:35:51,460 --> 01:35:52,984
I played very well.

1390
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:56,520
Of your eyes.

1391
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:59,040
I played it all the way through.

1392
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,000
We will always exist.

1393
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,024
And we will destroy you.

1394
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,048
We will destroy you, osman.

1395
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,280
[music is playing].

1396
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,200
You.

1397
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,440
You will only destroy yourself.

1398
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:21,720
So you spread the evil over all these years, huh?

1399
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:25,400
You have set many traps behind us.

1400
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,424
But.

1401
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,280
But nothing happened to you.

1402
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:34,600
I've been all this time.

1403
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,624
I took the lives of many cruel people.

1404
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:38,648
Eh.

1405
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,440
Hey look.

1406
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:44,480
These will be the last eyes you see.

1407
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,280
Last eyes.

1408
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:51,360
Your time has come.

1409
01:36:51,360 --> 01:38:20,200
[music is playing].

1410
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,320
Oh my selvi.

1411
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,640
You're welcome, sister.

1412
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,664
Thank you for the safe recovery.

1413
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,400
Thank you, sister.

1414
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,360
Welcome, selvi hatun.

1415
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:53,840
I don't know how to pay you.

1416
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,864
Especially osman bey.

1417
01:38:56,520 --> 01:38:58,160
How did he release nikola?

1418
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:00,520
It's yours in the middle.

1419
01:39:00,620 --> 01:39:02,080
While your people have lives.

1420
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,400
Osman bey, even for a minute.

1421
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,720
Selvi hatun did not think.

1422
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,440
Let there be.

1423
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,520
I was afraid when i came to the camp.

1424
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:12,120
That i will return emptyhanded.

1425
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,144
But osman bey.

1426
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:15,920
Ignoring his vengeance.

1427
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,944
Giving up the inegÃ¶l castle.

1428
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,120
Saved you, my selvi.

1429
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,200
I owe a life debt to informal osman bey.

1430
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,600
Let there be.

1431
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:29,440
Where is osman bey?

1432
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:30,920
I couldn't see.

1433
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:44,520
[music is playing].

1434
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:45,280
My sister.

1435
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,880
What is this preparation in the oba?

1436
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:50,080
It is preparation for conquest, sister.

1437
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:52,104
Mr. osman.

1438
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,440
He went to inegol to conquer.

1439
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:57,680
Oh my god.

1440
01:39:57,980 --> 01:39:58,960
What osman bey.

1441
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,880
Nor does kayÄ± oba stop.

1442

[music is playing].

1443
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,624
It would be appropriate for us to keep the end of the business.

1444
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:10,240
Then let the chicks of kÄ±zÄ±lbeyoÄlu oba come too.

1445
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:11,640
Let them come.

1446
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:13,280
A person is a person.

1447
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,800
Let's get ready for the conquest together.

1448
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,200
I hope, sister.

1449
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:19,440
Hopefully.

[music is playing].

1451
01:40:42,364 --> 01:40:44,440
Did it come in pieces in Ã§obanpÄ±nar location?

1452
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,240
He came, sir.

1453
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:45,740

Snake.

1456

Pilgrims.

1457
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:56,640
YunusiÃ§i.

1458
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,000
Baspinar.

1459
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:00,560
Twenty.

[music is playing].

1461
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,600
For ten years.

1462
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:07,720
Each part is different.

1463
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:09,480
The catapults we hide somewhere.

1464
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:11,560
It's time to unite, braves.

1465
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,760
Evalallah sir.

1466
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:25,660

1467
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:26,720
You carry.

1468
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,200
In each piece.

1469
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:30,800
Beautiful brave sweat.

1470
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,240
Has blood.

1471
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,880
For their right.

1472
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:38,040
With these catapults.

1473
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:40,064
The walls of inegol.

1474
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:41,920
I hope we will destroy it.

1475
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,640
I hope sir.

1476
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,800
Kefere martyred our valiants.

1477
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,760
Get in front of the fituhat.

1478
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:52,760
They think they've destroyed our ammunition.

1479
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:56,480
But they could not achieve their goals.

1480
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:59,520
Hallelujah.

The raid has begun.

1483

Alhamdulillah sir.

1484
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:10,120
Have the catapults at the apazik position arrived?

1485
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:11,280
One of them was missing, mr.

1486
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,600
I hope they are ok too.

1487
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:16,880
Come on then, valiant ones.

1488
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:19,600
We'll say bismillah and get to work.

1489

Build these catapults.

1490

Up to the front of the inegol walls.

1491
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:27,240
We will do it by god's grace.

01:42:31,880 --> 01:43:02,080
[music is playing].

1498
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:06,440
Aya nikola.

1499
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,000
He's back.

1500
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:10,440
Nobody.

1501
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:12,560
But no one's power.

1502
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,200
Not enough to enslave me.

1503
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,400
It wasn't enough.

1504
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,800
[music is playing].

1505
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,200
Not just me.

1506
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,280
No one can captivate my pen.

1507
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,920
It's just me.

1508
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,280
Only aya nikola can rule.

1509
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,720
Even if anyone has any intention of doing so.

1510
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,744
I will destroy them all.

1511
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,720
Never forget this.

1512
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:38,744
I.

1513
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:40,360
I am with you.

1514
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,384
You with me.

1515
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,400
Besides.

1516
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:46,960
Between us.

1517
01:43:47,460 --> 01:43:49,560
A great commander attended.

1518
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:52,320
Commander.

1519
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,560
Romanos

1520
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:58,920
I'm thirsty for blood.

1521
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:01,620
I.

1522
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:06,000
And aya nikola will walk first.

1523
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,760
You too will walk behind us.

1524
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:12,360
Brave soldiers.

1525
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,040
Are you with us?.

1526
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,160
We are with you, private nikola. we are with you, private nikola.

1527
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:19,940
We are with you, commander romanos. we are with you, commander romanos.

1528
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:21,720
We are with you, private nikola. we are with you, private nikola.

1529
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,440
We are with you, commander romanos. we are with you, commander romanos.

1530
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,080
We are with you, private nikola. we are with you, private nikola.

1531
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,720
We are with you, commander romanos. we are with you, commander romanos.

1532
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,360
We are with you, private nikola. we are with you, private nikola.

1533
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,120
We are with you, commander romanos. we are with you, commander romanos.

1534
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:31,720
We are with you, private nikola. we are with you, private nikola.

1535
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,760
We are with you, commander romanos. we are with you, commander romanos.

1536
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,680
When you arrive in oba, don't be.

1537
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:37,720
I don't want any mistakes.

1538
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,744
You know what you're going to do.

1539
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,768
Have no doubt, sir.

1540
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,080
Find me if something goes wrong.

1541
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:45,560
Go now.

1542
01:44:46,320 --> 01:45:01,200
[music is playing].

1543
01:45:09,596 --> 01:45:10,623
Ah.

1544
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:12,380
It was my mother.

1545
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,440
Working in unison without breathing.

1546
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:16,040
He had seen the ladies.

1547
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:18,343
How proud was he?

1548
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,819
Is it aygul?.

1549
01:45:19,819 --> 01:45:22,280
We have no other guide, my bala.

1550
01:45:22,792 --> 01:45:24,792
[music is playing].

1551
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:26,320
Most of all.

1552
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:28,814
Most of all.

1553
01:45:29,637 --> 01:45:32,440
It hurts me not being able to say goodbye to your last journey.

1554
01:45:33,358 --> 01:45:34,609
Don't, my aygÃ¼l.

1555
01:45:34,609 --> 01:45:35,711
[music is playing].

1556
01:45:35,711 --> 01:45:37,711
Thankfully he left without looking back.

1557
01:45:38,534 --> 01:45:40,309
He gave his life peacefully.

1558
01:45:40,309 --> 01:45:41,336
[music is playing].

1559
01:45:41,336 --> 01:45:42,886
You will be praying.

1560
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:48,404
[music is playing].

1561
01:45:48,778 --> 01:45:50,403
Oh selcan ana.

1562
01:45:51,002 --> 01:45:53,002
All these years have not been a little mother to us.

1563
01:45:54,424 --> 01:45:56,424
It will be very difficult to get used to your absence.

1564
01:45:56,873 --> 01:45:57,900
[music is playing].

1565
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,900
I hope god rests his place in heaven.

1566
01:46:01,023 --> 01:46:01,750
Amine.

1567
01:46:02,573 --> 01:46:03,820
Amine.

1568
01:46:04,718 --> 01:46:06,568
Thank you selvi hatun.

1569
01:46:06,568 --> 01:46:10,215
[music is playing].

1570
01:46:10,589 --> 01:46:11,766
I'm ayÅe.

1571
01:46:13,487 --> 01:46:15,000
Stop, don't do it alone.

1572
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,225
Fasting, you will be exhausted.

1573
01:46:17,225 --> 01:46:18,102
[music is playing].

1574
01:46:18,102 --> 01:46:20,776
Next to what the alps and bacÄ±lar did.

1575
01:46:21,374 --> 01:46:23,299
What are we doing, bala?

1576
01:46:25,448 --> 01:46:27,673
We will be tired but it will be worth it.

1577
01:46:27,673 --> 01:46:30,496
[music is playing].

1578
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:32,870
Bless your heart, my darlings.

1579
01:46:33,693 --> 01:46:36,591
But don't tire yourself, take turns.

1580
01:46:36,591 --> 01:46:38,292
Listen to your work, hey.

1581
01:46:38,742 --> 01:46:42,015
[music is playing].

1582
01:46:42,389 --> 01:46:44,688
It is not befitting for a woman to rest illegally.

1583
01:46:44,688 --> 01:46:45,566
Bala hatun.

1584
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:47,566
[music is playing].

1585
01:46:47,865 --> 01:46:49,865
Oh my god, what a beautiful thing you said.

1586
01:46:50,614 --> 01:46:53,887
I hope we will work nonstop until we get inegÃ¶l.

1587
01:46:53,887 --> 01:46:55,138
Hopefully.

1588
01:46:55,138 --> 01:46:56,165
[music is playing].

1589
01:46:56,539 --> 01:46:58,764
The chicks raised by my mother selcan.

1590
01:46:58,764 --> 01:47:00,764
[music is playing].

1591
01:47:00,764 --> 01:47:02,764
Don't be left behind, my mother.

1592
01:47:02,764 --> 01:47:07,609
[music is playing].

1593
01:47:08,432 --> 01:47:10,432
Your sons work for the oban.

1594
01:47:10,432 --> 01:47:13,929
[music is playing].

1595
01:47:14,228 --> 01:47:15,854
Give it to me, my alaeddin.

1596
01:47:15,854 --> 01:47:19,552
[music is playing].

1597
01:47:19,926 --> 01:47:23,049
Oh my god, my beautiful children.

1598
01:47:23,049 --> 01:47:25,049
[music is playing].

1599
01:47:25,423 --> 01:47:26,674
My valiants.

1600
01:47:26,674 --> 01:47:30,321
[music is playing].

1601
01:47:30,620 --> 01:47:33,219
If you don't take it to war, so will we.

1602
01:47:33,219 --> 01:47:34,620
We said let's help out, mother bala.

1603
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:35,946
Masallah.

1604
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:38,171
Your time will come too.

1605
01:47:38,171 --> 01:47:41,069
Until that day comes, the ground of the drillhouse.

1606
01:47:41,069 --> 01:47:42,844
You will water it with the sweat of your forehead.

1607
01:47:42,844 --> 01:47:44,844
[music is playing].

1608
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Bala anan says it's true, my lion.

1609
01:47:47,299 --> 01:47:49,299
Surely your time is near.

1610
01:47:49,299 --> 01:47:52,219
[music is playing].

1611
01:47:52,743 --> 01:47:54,968
Do not tire yourself more, my beautiful girl.

1612
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:58,289
[music is playing].

1613
01:47:58,289 --> 01:48:00,000
Where does the ammunition go, main?

1614
01:48:00,449 --> 01:48:02,000
Let's help as we go.

1615
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,898
[music is playing].

1616
01:48:05,272 --> 01:48:08,020
Ä°negÃ¶l with its ammunition bacÄ±lar.

1617
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:10,021
We will take you to your headquarters, alaeddin.

1618
01:48:10,021 --> 01:48:20,854
[music is playing].

1619
01:48:21,228 --> 01:48:22,854
Who is baysungur from?

1620
01:48:22,854 --> 01:48:24,555
What saying does kÃ¶sler steal?

1621
01:48:24,854 --> 01:48:27,303
Holafira's aunt's soldiers have arrived, malhun hatun.

1622
01:48:27,303 --> 01:48:30,725
[music is playing].

1623
01:48:31,099 --> 01:48:32,446
They've come a long way.

1624
01:48:32,446 --> 01:48:33,922
Let's host tonight.

1625
01:48:33,922 --> 01:48:35,922
You take it to the guest tent, and so will i.

1626
01:48:35,922 --> 01:48:38,671
I hope to see you when available.

1627
01:48:39,045 --> 01:48:50,178
[music is playing].

1628
01:48:50,477 --> 01:48:51,429
Come on.

1629
01:48:51,429 --> 01:48:52,680
Let's get down to business.

1630
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:54,680
Come on guys, have a rest.

1631
01:48:54,680 --> 01:49:03,538
[music is playing].

1632
01:49:03,987 --> 01:49:06,436
Osman has nothing in his hands anymore.

1633
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,361
I destroyed your headquarters.

1634
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:11,783
I took the ammunition he had accumulated over the years.

1635
01:49:12,232 --> 01:49:15,355
The most important are the mines.

1636
01:49:15,355 --> 01:49:17,954
Long live master arius with his mind.

1637
01:49:18,253 --> 01:49:20,478
Osman is nothing without his mines.

1638
01:49:20,478 --> 01:49:22,478
[music is playing].

1639
01:49:22,777 --> 01:49:25,001
Still a great danger.

1640
01:49:25,001 --> 01:49:26,028
[music is playing].

1641
01:49:26,028 --> 01:49:28,028
But i have to give arius his due.

1642
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:31,450
Always thinking about the next step.

1643
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:33,207
E, that's why we call him.

1644
01:49:33,207 --> 01:49:35,899
We call master arius, romanos.

1645
01:49:36,198 --> 01:49:38,893
If you say master arius.

1646
01:49:39,268 --> 01:49:40,369
You do well.

1647
01:49:41,417 --> 01:49:44,088
Judging by his silence anyway.

1648
01:49:44,462 --> 01:49:46,462
He has already taken possession of the mines.

1649
01:49:47,585 --> 01:49:49,435
So will it work?

1650
01:49:49,959 --> 01:49:51,435
Come to the bottom of our pen.

1651
01:49:51,435 --> 01:49:54,109
They will set up a headquarters and then with a catapult.

1652
01:49:54,109 --> 01:49:57,156
They will attack, right?

1653
01:49:57,156 --> 01:50:00,653
We just stopped their next attack, nikola.

1654
01:50:00,653 --> 01:50:03,402
[music is playing].

1655
01:50:03,402 --> 01:50:06,352
And i'm so tired of talking about it.

1656
01:50:06,801 --> 01:50:09,550
[music is playing].

1657
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:11,550
When arius came.

1658
01:50:12,673 --> 01:50:14,448
I will raise a great army.

1659
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,674
[music is playing].

1660
01:50:17,674 --> 01:50:20,123
I didn't come here to stand behind the walls.

1661
01:50:20,123 --> 01:50:22,123
[music is playing].

1662
01:50:22,572 --> 01:50:24,422
I came to shed blood.

1663
01:50:24,422 --> 01:50:35,779
[music is playing].

1664
01:50:35,779 --> 01:51:08,396
[music is playing].

1665
01:51:08,396 --> 01:51:28,961
[music is playing].

1666
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:30,437
You may exist.

1667
01:51:31,485 --> 01:51:32,587
You may exist.

1668
01:51:32,886 --> 01:51:34,631
[music is playing].

1669
01:51:35,454 --> 01:51:36,855
Oh my god.

1670
01:51:36,855 --> 01:51:38,911
[music is playing].

1671
01:51:39,285 --> 01:51:40,312
Brother.

1672
01:51:40,911 --> 01:51:42,462
Just say it.

1673
01:51:42,462 --> 01:51:43,713
What is the mood?.

1674
01:51:44,312 --> 01:51:46,162
These are the last ones.

1675
01:51:46,162 --> 01:51:47,413
Are these both gone?

1676
01:51:47,862 --> 01:51:49,862
All the catapults are in front of the inegÃ¶l walls.

1677
01:51:50,236 --> 01:51:51,563
Know it settled down, sir.

1678
01:51:52,536 --> 01:51:54,386
So, what's the strength like?

1679
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:56,685
Are our catapults kavi, aÄa bey?

1680
01:51:57,808 --> 01:51:59,509
It's all right, isn't it?

1681
01:51:59,509 --> 01:52:01,057
Won't let us down.

1682
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:05,003
Osman bey does not let go, he does not let go, he is a tribe.

1683
01:52:05,976 --> 01:52:07,004
The walls of inegol.

1684
01:52:07,528 --> 01:52:09,528
We will destroy it with these catapults, with god's permission.

1685
01:52:10,726 --> 01:52:11,828
Hopefully.

1686
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:15,250
I hope we will destroy them.

1687
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:39,080
[music is playing].

1688
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:41,604
We turned the villagers who brought goods from their way, mr.

1689
01:52:41,604 --> 01:52:43,604
They do not make an effort for the informal inegÃ¶l.

1690
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,473
Sir, another caravan was coming.

1691
01:52:46,473 --> 01:52:48,572
We hit it, we stacked the goods around.

1692
01:52:50,069 --> 01:52:51,395
You shot someone.

1693
01:52:51,844 --> 01:52:53,245
What about the rest?

1694
01:52:53,245 --> 01:52:56,967
The sentence of the supply routes has the power of immaterial.

1695
01:52:56,967 --> 01:52:57,851
What a commodity.

1696
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,191
What a waste of money, sir.

1697
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:06,417
[music is playing].

1698
01:53:06,417 --> 01:53:09,540
So we cut the whole lifeblood of inegÃ¶l.

1699
01:53:11,935 --> 01:53:13,561
In front of being turkish property.

1700
01:53:13,561 --> 01:53:15,486
There are no obstacles.

1701
01:53:17,956 --> 01:53:19,956
Let them know that we stopped.

1702
01:53:24,073 --> 01:53:25,172
But.

1703
01:53:25,771 --> 01:53:28,823
We will continue to march on the oppressors.

1704
01:53:28,823 --> 01:53:50,811
[music is playing].

1705
01:53:51,185 --> 01:53:52,137
Sir.

1706
01:53:52,137 --> 01:53:52,790
Talk.

1707
01:53:53,239 --> 01:53:55,913
Sir, osman, osman and turks are coming.

1708
01:53:56,811 --> 01:54:00,000
Catapults, ram heads and other equipment.

1709
01:54:02,395 --> 01:54:04,844
If you lit the catapults.

1710
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:08,341
What is this coming, nikola?

1711
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:12,491
[music is playing].

1712
01:54:13,689 --> 01:54:17,336
Do you know that emerald phoenix?

1713
01:54:19,336 --> 01:54:21,336
Here his name is turk.

1714
01:54:23,057 --> 01:54:25,880
With the light of islam in our hearts.

1715
01:54:26,404 --> 01:54:27,958
From where it burned.

1716
01:54:28,333 --> 01:54:30,875
We will be resurrected alhamdulillah.

1717
01:54:31,324 --> 01:54:32,853
Yak nikola.

1718
01:54:32,853 --> 01:54:33,877
Approx.

1719
01:54:34,626 --> 01:54:37,375
You will also have plenty of fire in the hereafter.

1720
01:54:39,899 --> 01:54:41,899
Phoenix.

1721
01:54:41,899 --> 01:54:45,382
[music is playing].

1722
01:54:46,131 --> 01:54:48,131
Phoenix.

1723
01:54:48,954 --> 01:54:50,580
How did they do this?.

1724
01:54:51,403 --> 01:54:52,430
How?.

1725
01:54:52,879 --> 01:54:54,430
Damn.

1726
01:54:54,430 --> 01:54:56,131
How many catapults are there?

1727
01:54:56,131 --> 01:54:57,906
Sir, i count five.

1728
01:54:57,906 --> 01:54:58,858
I can't count.

1729
01:54:58,858 --> 01:55:00,000
Uhhh.

1730
01:55:00,374 --> 01:55:03,422
Well, i was only able to break the branches of the tree.

1731
01:55:03,422 --> 01:55:05,644
Its roots extended to the pen.

1732
01:55:05,967 --> 01:55:10,887
[music is playing].

1733
01:55:10,887 --> 01:55:12,887
What do you say, nikola?

1734
01:55:14,887 --> 01:55:15,989
Open talk.

1735
01:55:18,983 --> 01:55:21,387
The trade they made to inegÃ¶l is romanos.

1736
01:55:21,387 --> 01:55:24,285
Caravans carrying their goods.

1737
01:55:24,809 --> 01:55:27,857
The cars in which the goods are loaded.

1738
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:30,763
They just.

1739
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:34,041
They carried their own ammunition.

1740
01:55:35,239 --> 01:55:36,865
For years.

1741
01:55:38,212 --> 01:55:40,212
Where is the headquarters that osman established?

1742
01:55:40,212 --> 01:55:42,535
Looking for where.

1743
01:55:43,882 --> 01:55:46,107
They set up the headquarters next to us.

1744
01:55:46,856 --> 01:55:48,544
We couldn't see.

1745
01:55:51,463 --> 01:55:53,463
It was you who had to see.

1746
01:55:53,912 --> 01:55:59,356
[music is playing].

1747
01:55:59,356 --> 01:56:01,356
You were supposed to see.

1748
01:56:01,356 --> 01:56:04,551
[music is playing].

1749
01:56:04,925 --> 01:56:06,925
Then we know what we're going to do.

1750
01:56:08,925 --> 01:56:12,198
We will do what we know best.

1751
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,850
We will fight.

1752
01:56:16,850 --> 01:56:27,234
[music is playing].

1753
01:56:27,234 --> 01:56:29,234
We will fight.

1754
01:56:29,234 --> 01:56:47,950
[music is playing].

1755
01:56:47,950 --> 01:56:48,613
Alps.

1756
01:56:51,383 --> 01:56:52,720
Guardians.

1757
01:56:53,693 --> 01:56:55,693
The walls of inegÃ¶l are curved.

1758
01:56:57,190 --> 01:56:58,367
But.

1759
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:01,340
Not as much as our determination.

1760
01:57:05,533 --> 01:57:06,792
Since then.

1761
01:57:07,914 --> 01:57:10,962
They do not accept to surrender peacefully.

1762
01:57:13,283 --> 01:57:15,283
The time has come.

1763
01:57:17,678 --> 01:57:20,052
We will make a breach in the inegol walls.

1764
01:57:21,025 --> 01:57:23,025
When pedestrians start walking.

1765
01:57:23,774 --> 01:57:25,176
Our archers.

1766
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:27,849
They will start shooting the archers above the castle.

1767
01:57:30,319 --> 01:57:31,645
But.

1768
01:57:31,645 --> 01:57:34,918
When you try to break through those breaches.

1769
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:38,040
Down from the bastions of the castle.

1770
01:57:38,489 --> 01:57:40,489
They will start to spill oil.

1771
01:57:42,448 --> 01:57:44,407
We will still be cautious.

1772
01:57:45,605 --> 01:57:46,856
Guards.

1773
01:57:47,155 --> 01:57:49,155
May we be blessed.

[music is playing].

1784
01:58:51,751 --> 01:58:53,751
They come.

1785
01:58:55,377 --> 01:58:58,350
Which turkmen who hears the influx of people will stop.

1786
01:59:00,350 --> 01:59:01,676
They come.

1787
01:59:06,617 --> 01:59:07,848
They come.

Brave sons of byzantium.

01:59:12,842 --> 01:59:14,318
My soldiers.

1790
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,434
The big day has come now.

1791
01:59:18,482 --> 01:59:21,087
The enemy that has nested next to us for years.

1792
01:59:21,536 --> 01:59:23,311
Rested on our walls.

1793
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:27,407

1794
01:59:27,407 --> 01:59:28,509
I.

Aya nikola.

1796
01:59:31,932 --> 01:59:33,932
Death for years.

1797
01:59:34,231 --> 01:59:36,231
I feel it on my back.

1798
01:59:37,353 --> 01:59:38,680
But i'm not afraid.

1799
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:39,931
I was not afraid.

1800
01:59:39,931 --> 01:59:41,632
I will not be afraid.

1801
01:59:44,626 --> 01:59:46,252
So what are we going to do?

1802
01:59:46,926 --> 01:59:49,450
We will take their breath away.

1803
01:59:49,824 --> 01:59:51,001
My soldiers.

1804
01:59:51,375 --> 01:59:52,701
Today.

1805
01:59:52,701 --> 01:59:54,177
Your swords.

1806
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,497
Today is the day to earn your shields.

1807
01:59:59,170 --> 02:00:00,000
Death.

1808
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:03,619
Will be at the tip of your swords today.

1809
02:00:05,790 --> 02:00:07,041
And we turks.

1810
02:00:08,539 --> 02:00:10,090
With these swords.

1811
02:00:10,539 --> 02:00:13,952
We will make inegÃ¶l a tomb for the turks.

1812
02:00:13,952 --> 02:00:15,000
Tomb.

1814
02:00:18,355 --> 02:00:21,178
They will make rifts in our walls.

1815
02:00:23,178 --> 02:00:24,355
Beware.

1816
02:00:25,478 --> 02:00:27,478
Don't be afraid.

1817
02:00:27,927 --> 02:00:29,104
Don't take a step back.

1818
02:00:29,104 --> 02:00:30,655
And don't.

1819
02:00:31,853 --> 02:00:33,104
Because we.

1820
02:00:33,703 --> 02:00:34,962
To those breaches.

1821
02:00:35,935 --> 02:00:38,997
We'll stick the skulls of the turks.

I'm not afraid.

Don't be afraid either.

1828
02:00:58,802 --> 02:01:00,428
With me.

1829
02:01:02,224 --> 02:01:04,449
Who wants to shed the blood of the turks?

02:01:04,449 --> 02:01:05,401
We.

1831
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:06,952

02:04:12,113 --> 02:04:13,036
How long are the raids?

1862
02:04:13,036 --> 02:04:14,562
The news was not given to the tribes.

1863
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,760
We did not hear your call, osman bey.

1864
02:04:20,455 --> 02:04:23,493
Whichever horse you ride will bring you to inegÃ¶l.

1865
02:04:25,065 --> 02:04:26,653
Gaza is here.

1866
02:04:27,775 --> 02:04:29,476
Conquest is here.

1867
02:04:30,449 --> 02:04:32,150
What do you need to call?

1868
02:04:33,123 --> 02:04:34,898
Now you have the news.

1869
02:04:38,566 --> 02:04:39,334
Thanks.

1870
02:04:40,008 --> 02:04:41,634
Thank you, as you say.

1871
02:04:44,628 --> 02:04:46,320
Turkmen nations.

1872
02:04:48,491 --> 02:04:50,752
You agreed to come for conquest.

1873
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:54,025
May you all exist.

1874
02:04:55,276 --> 02:04:56,527
You are welcome.

1875
02:04:56,549 --> 02:04:58,549
Welcome, mr.

1876
02:05:02,181 --> 02:05:04,256
You will be under my command.

1877
02:05:05,154 --> 02:05:08,189
Your alps are with boran and konur.

1878
02:05:09,087 --> 02:05:10,618
They will enter through gedik.

1879
02:05:11,217 --> 02:05:13,931
Some of them are with turgut bey.

1880
02:05:14,605 --> 02:05:15,969
They will attack from behind.

1881
02:05:19,263 --> 02:05:20,938
And those who will come with me.

1882
02:05:21,986 --> 02:05:24,435
Smash the gate of the castle with the ram's head.

1883
02:05:24,959 --> 02:05:26,056
They will go in.

1884
02:05:29,649 --> 02:05:31,326
Of course we won't be one.

1885
02:05:32,898 --> 02:05:35,435
Many brave men burning with the love of conquest.

1886
02:05:36,333 --> 02:05:38,384
I hope it will come to the walls of inegÃ¶l and stand.

1887
02:05:42,127 --> 02:05:43,636
My grandfather is suleyman shah.

1888
02:05:44,534 --> 02:05:46,889
We have not stopped since my ancestor ertuÄrul gazi.

1889
02:05:47,862 --> 02:05:51,156
It will not stop for us and after us.

1890
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:56,588
May our other gaza be blessed.

1891
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,296
Allahu akbar.

1892
02:06:01,296 --> 02:06:24,721
Allahu akbar.

1893
02:06:35,351 --> 02:06:38,049
My lord, the castle gates are opened.

1894
02:06:38,798 --> 02:06:40,028
The news spread.

1895
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:57,501
Here you go.

1896
02:06:59,148 --> 02:07:00,429
I'll send your cook soon.

1897
02:07:01,627 --> 02:07:04,365
You are road tired, rest as much as you want.

1898
02:07:04,889 --> 02:07:07,350
We are grateful, but i was wondering.

1899
02:07:07,949 --> 02:07:09,662
What is the reason for the mobility in the camp?

1900
02:07:09,662 --> 02:07:10,855
Is there a dangerous situation?

1901
02:07:12,726 --> 02:07:14,158
There is nothing to fear.

1902
02:07:14,607 --> 02:07:16,690
As i said, take your rest.

1903
02:07:17,064 --> 02:07:20,092
After all, malhun hatun will meet with you.

1904
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:35,242
Now you rest, we will wait for the night to move.

1905
02:08:02,907 --> 02:08:03,956
Whoo.

1906
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:34,680
[music is playing].

1907
02:08:42,252 --> 02:08:43,177
Nicholas.

1908
02:08:44,150 --> 02:08:45,378
Mr. osman.

1909
02:08:47,849 --> 02:08:50,022
Let him surrender your castle with peace.

1910
02:08:52,043 --> 02:08:56,338
Both your castle and your soldiers are unharmed.

1911
02:08:58,135 --> 02:09:01,956
Don't worry, i'll forgive them all.

1912
02:09:02,687 --> 02:09:04,990
Will you forgive me?

1913
02:09:07,011 --> 02:09:09,159
You underestimate me, osman bey.

1914
02:09:10,506 --> 02:09:14,476
I'm aya nikola, we've been fighting all these years.

1915
02:09:16,572 --> 02:09:18,439
Do you think i'll hand over the pen?

1916
02:09:19,313 --> 02:09:23,631
I captured many members of your father and family there.

1917
02:09:23,631 --> 02:09:28,160
It wasn't enough, i tortured their alps there.

1918
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,440
I won't give you my pen.

1919
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:35,689
He has a memory.

1920
02:09:36,812 --> 02:09:38,482
That's why i pity you.

1921
02:09:42,115 --> 02:09:44,200
You will lose everything.

1922
02:09:46,538 --> 02:09:50,120
Your castle, your life.

1923
02:09:57,650 --> 02:10:01,995
If you don't surrender, a lot of blood will be spilled.

1924
02:10:03,717 --> 02:10:10,597
And you know me well, i spill that blood.

1925
02:10:12,543 --> 02:10:14,635
You will shed more blood.

1926
02:10:17,929 --> 02:10:24,072
Osman bey, this is inegÃ¶l, my land.

1927
02:10:27,141 --> 02:10:32,867
I am not afraid, neither are my soldiers.

1928
02:10:39,904 --> 02:10:41,676
I'm warning you for the last time.

1929
02:10:44,596 --> 02:10:46,069
Hand over your castle.

1930
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:54,133
The wind of these lands is for the fluctuation of the islamic banner.

1931
02:10:54,732 --> 02:10:58,903
That wind has not yet hit the walls of inegÃ¶l.

1932
02:10:59,652 --> 02:11:03,145
My pen is dungeon enough for all of you.

1933
02:11:04,418 --> 02:11:07,432
There are enough swords to cut all of you.

1934
02:11:24,125 --> 02:11:25,497
Is that your decision?

1935
02:11:27,892 --> 02:11:30,535
This is my decision, osman bey.

1936
02:11:32,481 --> 02:11:35,697
Inegol is here, come and get it.

1937
02:11:36,296 --> 02:11:37,907
If you can afford it.

1938
02:11:43,746 --> 02:11:45,120
I did my duty.

1939
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Thanks.

1940
02:11:54,607 --> 02:11:59,227
We also use our power on inegÃ¶l.

1941
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:07,932
Ä°negÃ¶l is the property of informal islam.

1942
02:12:07,932 --> 02:12:34,334
[music is playing].

1943
02:12:34,334 --> 02:12:35,286
Deh.

1944
02:12:47,938 --> 02:12:52,705
We are the generation of those who ride horses where they can't see.

1945
02:12:54,876 --> 02:12:58,015
Until this time, we waited for inegÃ¶l for a long time.

1946
02:12:59,662 --> 02:13:01,346
You should inform the informal gentlemen.

1947
02:13:02,228 --> 02:13:04,228
Tell the alps.

1948
02:13:05,665 --> 02:13:07,085
Let the catapults be driven.

1949
02:13:08,283 --> 02:13:09,668
Prepare the ram head.

1950
02:13:11,165 --> 02:13:13,795
And for the last time, you can sharpen your pusats.

1951
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:23,048
It is a time of conquest.

1952
02:13:26,791 --> 02:13:27,488
Yah.
