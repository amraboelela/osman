00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:35,195
My guardian, wake up.

[Music is playing].

7
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:39,424
Ahh.

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,149

[Music is playing].

13
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,607
We need to get out of here quickly.

[Music is playing].

15
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:14,045
This is very bad, Orhan brother.

16
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,393
We became a trump card in the hands of the infidel.

17
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:21,140
We will not get angry, we will run away, my friend.

18
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:22,262
Lets.

19
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:32,509
No soldiers are visible around.

20
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:36,958
God, give me strength.

21
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,961
What, are you trying to escape?

22
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:58,582
Come look, we had fun.

23
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:06,856
The man who will bend that iron will not be captured either.

24
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:09,224
Calm down, brat.

25
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:12,323
What does the infidel Turk hold?

26
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:13,231
what wall.

27
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,159
Let me show you when you open that lock.

[Music is playing].

29
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:24,477
Well, brother, does the dog enter the wolf's den?

30
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:29,476
The dog that comes with a time will come in, my guard.

32
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:35,075

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,122
Now I you.

God is right.

39
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:05,903
Did you see the power now?

They're low.

42

Let us go.

43
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,977
Let go.

Osman Bey will not bring this with you.

49
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:15,000
When he hears, he will destroy your castle.

50
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,738
Osman will die, there is no hope for you.

51
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:18,901
Shut up so you don't die tired.

53
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,590
Come on, that's enough rest.

Alps.

56
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:45,444
Open your eyes, be cautious.

57
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:50,152
Our disguise is a button, but our pusat is sharp beforehand.

58
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:52,353
Let's go to the conquest, come on.

59
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:56,869
Come on, sisters, come on.

60
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,679
There are people coming.

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,270
There are people coming.

62
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,858
No, I hope.

honey.

68
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,829
They kidnapped the children.

69
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:24,518
What? Who when?

70
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:28,037
There is no time for information, they took the children to Bilecik.

71
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,210
Let's get to Bilecik then, come on.

72
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,001
Come on.

73
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,904
Osman Bey comes.

74
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:47,699
[Music is playing].

75
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:50,677
Osman.

76
00:07:50,677 --> 00:07:52,156
They kidnapped the children.

77
00:07:52,156 --> 00:07:54,195
I know Malhun, I know.

78
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,819
Our children, what if something happens to them, Osman.

79
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,351
It won't.

80
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:02,730
They attacked in Kosses, but now he went to the camp.

81
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:07,832
If they want to take the lives of our children.

82
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,054
they would not have taken him to Bilecik at that time.

83
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:14,419
So what are their intentions? To use it as leverage?

84
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,874
They were going to kill us in the castle, our sons are seeking revenge.

85
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,060
Let them not fall.

86
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,888
They have known us for a long time.

87
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:26,035
Of course they know that we will not go unprepared.

88
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:30,000
That's why they want to hit us in our soft belly.

89
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,819
But.

90
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,490
I will not protect my children in their hands.

91
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:38,969
Nor their souls in their bodies.

92
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,406
Let's take Bilecik on their heads then.

93
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:43,896
No.

94
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,716
malhun.

95
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:48,700
Not with our pain.

96
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:53,367
We will act with our minds.

[Music is playing].

98
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:20,703
Ahh.

99
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,288
Osman is dead.

100
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:34,787
[Music is playing].

101
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,876
Osman will sit here exactly.

102
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:42,279
Assassins are here, they will be here too.

103
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,008
There will be soldiers of Justinian besides you inside.

104
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:49,457
It doesn't matter where Osman lives, Nikola.

105
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,381
Precaution, love.

106
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:58,566
You taught me not to belittle anyone in battle, master.

107
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,756
I will not leave the door open.

108
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:05,925
You choose your word best, Nikola.

109
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:12,497
Aya Nikola, Master Arius, this is Bilecik castle.

110
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:15,000
But history, this castle, Turkmen lords.

111
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,253
He will write it as his tomb.

112
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:17,985
Have no doubt.

113
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:24,814
The outside jugglers, actors, musicians are all on their waists.

114
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:27,267
daggers, thirsty for Turkish blood.

115
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,926
Did you tell them your real purpose?

116
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:32,542
Huh.

117
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:34,230
Of course no.

118
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,821
I haven't said it yet, so that the information doesn't leak.

119
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:41,420
They think they are armed only as a precaution.

120
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:46,637
When the attack approaches, they will learn that Bilecik will be full of blood.

121
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:49,035
But the Turks will not be satisfied.

122
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:51,347
They are fasting.

123
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:54,785
That holy iftar will be their last meal.

124
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:57,696
Congratulations Justinian, congratulations.

125
00:10:57,696 --> 00:11:01,407
You're not a wimp like your Uncle Rogatus.

126
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:04,678
Perpetuated in these lands for many years by order of the emperor.

127
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:06,283
peace tonight.

128
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:08,932
it's ending.

129
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,833
What about Osman's children?

130
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,393
What will happen to them?

131
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:18,831
No one will touch them, they will wait for me.

132
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:23,036
Alps, women, even Osman.

133
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:25,785
You can kill them all with pleasure.

134
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,496
[Music is playing].

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,164
First, we will know where our children are.

136
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:36,434
Without any information.

137
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:39,953
We will not fall into the hands of those dogs who want to kill us.

138
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:45,865
[Music is playing].

139
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:47,793
This is obviously their move.

140
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:51,739
You say right, Osman Bey, in case of a wedding.

141
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:54,108
If we take precautions, we will succumb to our anger.

142
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,418
They want us to attack.

143
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:56,845
We will be cautious.

144
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:59,298
[Music is playing].

145
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:00,708
What do you say, Mr.

146
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:04,007
We set out on this road to take Bilecik castle.

147
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:07,677
They kidnapped our children.

148
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,427
They attacked Kosses.

149
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:13,794
[Music is playing].

150
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:17,868
Obviously, they obviously get their job done.

151
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,480
We will die too.

152
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,936
But we don't have a trump card like them.

153
00:12:26,436 --> 00:12:28,335
We'll go to the ambush, Osman Bey.

154
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,427
How will you say this?

155
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,932
You will see, Mr. Turgut.

156
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:38,402
Before night falls, my children will be with me.

157
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:45,334
And Bilecik castle will be our property.

158
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:48,529
Hopefully.

159
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:49,376
I hope Mr.

160
00:12:49,876 --> 00:12:50,726
I hope Mr.

161
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:59,211
[Music is playing].

162
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:02,650
Justinian, describing what will happen in this hall.

163
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,080
surprised us.

164
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:06,855
Master Arius, what are you doing out there?

165
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:08,877
Do you want to tell what will happen?

166
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,702
When there was a massacre in the castle, when Osman's lineage dried up.

167
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:18,179
willow, the camp will be headless.

168
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:20,845
And Barkin.

169
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:21,497
How?.

170
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:25,107
Isn't Barkın one of the gentlemen who will die?

171
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,413
Justinian.

172
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:32,983
true loyalty is what not everyone knows.

173
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:38,613
Barkin has been loyal to me for years, just like you.

174
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:43,759
But Kosses, not like that.

175
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,988
Kosses is dead and gone.

176
00:13:46,988 --> 00:13:49,498
[Music is playing].

177
00:13:49,848 --> 00:13:53,775
You will kill Justinian, Osman and the others.

178
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,556
Barkin will take Söğüt.

179
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,350
Willow has become very rich.

180
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,290
Osman became very rich.

181
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:07,663
You'll get your share too, don't worry.

182
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:08,515
Me too.

183
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:12,001
I will take my mine.

184
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:16,420
And you, master Arius, what will you do?

185
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,345
Before turning the skull into a slurry.

186
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:23,726
I will destroy your catapults.

187
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:26,195
I will destroy their weapons.

188
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:29,224
Osman is in preparation for an expedition.

189
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,456
That time I will destroy your dream.

190
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:38,271
Someone will take over the sanjak, which the Turks consider sacred.

191
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:43,451
Remember Justinian, you cannot stop the Turks by killing them.

192
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:47,665
One for them, one to serve you.

193
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:49,262
You have to place a man.

194
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:53,322
That person is Barkin.

195
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:55,993
[Music is playing].

196
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:57,553
The war started.

197
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:01,499
Only Osman does not know.

198
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:03,545
Lets.

199
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:14,095
[Music is playing].

200
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:16,134
They set the trap in the castle.

201
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:19,077
but they keep hitting on the road.

202
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,693
Who else is on the way?

203
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:24,970
You say the wedding convoy, sir.

204
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:26,652
That's right.

205
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:30,000
Since his sons take the trump card.

206
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:34,851
then we will not go emptyhanded.

207
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:39,006
[Music is playing].

208
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:42,944
We will take Holofira, daughter of Yarhisar Tekfuru Basileus.

209
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,812
We're going to raid the wedding convoy.

210
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:47,880
Thanks.

211
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:51,300
honey.

212
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,965
malhun.

213
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:56,052
As if you were unaware of the children with me.

214
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:57,233
You will come to the castle.

215
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:02,689
If you see this as appropriate, I have my anger.

216
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:05,246
reins, I'll do what you say, Osman Bey.

217
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:10,222
Our hand is in the pusat, we will wait for your signal.

218
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:11,822
Thanks.

219
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:13,438
Thanks.

220
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:15,494
Mr. Turgut.

221
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:18,643
We will raid together with the Alps.

222
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:21,583
You will send Holofira to the camp.

223
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:25,042
Bilecik with his stepfather Basileus.

224
00:16:25,042 --> 00:16:26,183
You will come to your castle.

225
00:16:28,145 --> 00:16:29,687
We cannot enter the castle any other way.

226
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,405
We'll hit and pass, yes, but guys.

227
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,003
How do we save the children?

228
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,186
There's someone to find their location and let us know.

229
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,885
Who is my Bey?

230
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:47,457
[Music is playing].

231
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,077
My nephew, Aktemur.

232
00:16:49,077 --> 00:17:12,716
[Music is playing].

233
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:14,580
For now walk through your castles.

234
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:18,611
You will not even be able to take a step in what is the property of the Turk.

235
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:24,305
[Music is playing].

236
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,453
holofira

237
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,321
I raised you for these days.

238
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:51,346
You are your mother's gift to me.

239
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:54,537
I married him for power.

240
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,617
Although you are not my daughter.

241
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,141
I accepted you.

242
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:06,661
[Music is playing].

243
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:08,700
You will do the same.

244
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:14,356
We only make moves for holy Rome.

245
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:24,426
This marriage will make us stronger.

246
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:28,172
I don't want to be strong, I want to be happy.

247
00:18:28,172 --> 00:19:03,171
[Music is playing].

248
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:16,777
Hohog.

[Music is playing].

250
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,098
Tekfur Basileus.

251
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,632
Come on out of that hole.

252
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:46,749
[Music is playing].

253
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:10,747
What does this mean, Mr. Turgut?

254
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:14,535
After all these years of peace, what is a roadblock?

255
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:19,513
We will accompany you to Bilecik.

256
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:23,048
Let's see if the dagger in our throat is from you.

257
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,020
Damn.

258
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:30,510
Soldiers.

[Music is playing].

261
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,400
You have nowhere to run, Tekfur.

262
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:53,323
Kellen is heavy on your body, Tekfur.

263
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,223
Never worry.

264
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:59,112
We will relieve you of that burden.

265
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,876
Attack.

[Music is playing].

269
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,701
How long will we not fight shoulder to shoulder?

270
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:38,086
Is this what you say?

271
00:21:38,586 --> 00:21:39,576
Are you longing?.

272
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,571
I miss Cenk too.

273
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,858
During the war, I didn't miss your talk, Cerkutay.

274
00:21:57,244 --> 00:22:01,502
Well then, let me be silent, let my pusats talk.

275
00:22:05,263 --> 00:22:07,484
Hey, you'll do well.

Are you always like this?

You look like my Mari.

You take care of the girl.

I will come and get your father.

Are you going to stop us alone?

00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,850
Mr. Turgut.

303
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:14,413
Will you account for this?

304
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,768
We are not accountable to snakes.

305
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:20,862
We hold it by the neck, we ask for account.

306
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,998
Attack.

00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,583
You come across me and pretend to be innocent for peace.

The wedding we had planned was going to be your funeral, deyu.

We didn't kidnap you, we rescued you.

00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:41,547
Fear is informal.

[Music is playing].

333
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:38,045
When I gave Holofira, Tekfur would make me a partner in his trade.

334
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,678
In his castle, too, he had quite a lot of property.

The Turks, whom you call our enemies, are yours to me.

Aygül Hatun, leave Holofira to the camp.

346
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:29,636
Then tell your aunt with all your might.

00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,349
Cerkutay

348
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:36,100
You too, catch up with Osman Bey from your thesis.

352
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,478
This is Basileus too.

353
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:49,416
He will come to the wedding with us.

354
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,560
You're invited too, you bastard.

355
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,110
You too.

[Music is playing].

357
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,680
So you take out the iron here, Osman.

358
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Let's see where you work the iron in this?.

359
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Are they all loaded?

00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,640
We didn't leave a trace.

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,480
Good.

00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,384
Be careful, huh.

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:34,880
Lets.

364
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,880

00:31:15,464 --> 00:31:16,960
Sir, the task is complete.

Tekfur is in our hands.

368
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,760
His daughter is in Holofira.

369
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,784
My Bey, I go to the camp with Alpar.

370

Mr. Sungur Alp said their faces were hidden, my Sheikh said.

408
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,140
They were similar to the mendeburs years ago.

Do not withhold your prayers.

We're pretty tired.

I can't stand your absence.

How can you last all these years, Gunduz Bey?

Thank you Malhun Hatun.

It is as he said.

We know the location of the other dungeon.

558
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,160

How will we do this?.

You say fast.

00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,320
I think we should wait for him, brother.

570

I knew you would say that.

571

You choose to wait when you're in trouble.

572
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,680
What can we do, brother.

710
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,040
for being so calm.

I was actually surprised.

00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,880
Would it be okay to sneer at those who come from God, Kosses?.

713

It is up to us to pray patiently.

727

I gave you so much trouble.

Among so many problems.

729
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,400
And you messed with me.

For the life God gave.

731
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,720
Would it be a hassle to struggle, Kosses?.

732
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,440
I shed tears for my princes.

733
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,800
Let's leave you alone with your scars.

734
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,880
What is the use of prostrating five times a day?

735
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,880
I am not your coreligionist.

What if you are not our religion?

750
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,160
Have mercy on us.

751
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,280
It is the trust of the Messenger of Allah.

752
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,880
Sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam.

753
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,760
The merciful God.

754
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,160
blue sky.

755
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:41,980
rainy place.

756
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,080
if he put it at the service of all people.

757
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,440
We are also in need of those people.

758
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,160
approach with mercy.

759
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,880
In our wrath against the oppressor.

760
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,400
in our luring evil.

761
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,360
it is our compassion for the oppressed.

762
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,160
[Music is playing].

763
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,520
Thanks.

764
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,080
Thanks.

765
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:16,480
[Music is playing].

766
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,520
Abdurrahim.

767
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:18,760
Come on.

768
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:20,784
Show your skill.

769
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,920
Here is yours, sir.

770
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:55,940
Caesar Caesar Caesar Caesar.

771
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:04,940
[Music is playing].

772
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,660
Caesar Caesar Caesar Caesar.

774
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:41,520
Caesar Caesar Caesar Caesar.

775
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,640
Hey.

776
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:47,860
Caesar Caesar Caesar Caesar.

777
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,320
It's dangerous without armor, Osman Bey.

778
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,720
If you want.

779
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,800
No.

780
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,600
Armor weighs us down.

781
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:58,624
Keep going like this.

782
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,200
Come on.

783
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:15,800
[Music is playing].

784
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,960
Yuuuuh.

785
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:27,520
Yuuuuh.

786
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,840
Get up, Caesar.

787
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,580
Huh to you.

788
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:32,440
Whoa.

01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:40,140
[Music is playing].

790
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,856
Huh to you.

791
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,040
Yuuuuh.

792
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:46,040
Justinian could not cope with Caesar Abdurrahim.

793
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,400
At least when he calls for a few more of his soldiers.

794
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,720
be fair.

795
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,160
It is OK for me.

796
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:57,184
Soldiers.

797
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,480
Let's show our hospitality to our friends.

798

[Music is playing].

799
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,380
Shoot Shoot Shoot Shoot.

800
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,440
Is there such a thing?

801
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,720
Let's go in too, Mr. Ganja.

802
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,160
Come on, we're hunting, too.

803
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,280
You guys stop.

804
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,560
My gentleman wanted it.

805
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,960
Shoot Shoot Shoot Shoot.

806
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,984
Abdurrahim is capable of coping.

807
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:18,980
Let's watch.

808
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,360
Lay down.

[Music is playing].

811
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,520
It was a fair fight.

812
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,544
Your men fought well.

813
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,080
But.

814
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:50,080
They were only able to show acumen to Abdurrahim.

815
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,200
Thank you Osman Bey.

816
01:05:54,200 --> 01:06:04,800

817
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,560

sir.

821
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,480
The children are in the dungeon.

822
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,440
Bala Hatun is nearby.

823
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,520
We await your order.

824
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,520
We wait for iftar for food.

825
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,544
hey.

827
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,760
We are with you for iftar.

828
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,560
What meals did you make us prepare?

829
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,280
I made you incredible meals tonight.

830
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,120
Is that so?.

831
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,760
Thanks.

835
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,840
I'm out of gear.

836
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:16,720
You endure.

837

[Music is playing].

838
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,360
Ertugrul Gazi in your vein.

839

I have blood bro.

840
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,040
You won't leave right away.

841
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,520
Come on one more time.

842
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,400

Two.

844
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,600
Three.

845
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,300
Right.

846
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,000
A.

847
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,200
Two, three.

848
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,560
Right.

850
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,200
They moved, bro.

851
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,840
What will we do?

852
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,520
We need to act quickly.

853
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,480
Come on bro.

854
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:09,600
Let's do.

855
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,480
A.

856
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,880
Two. Two.

01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,160
Three. Three.

858
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,560
Right.

Two. Two.

862
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,200
Three. Three.

863
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,840
Right.

865
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,144
Martalos.

866
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,280
Osman Bey's tonight at Bilecik Castle.

867
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,920
He said he was going to be killed.

868
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:48,960
Will he be killed?

869
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,020
We must immediately inform the camp and unite.

870
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,320
Mr. Barkin.

871
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,344
We need to go to Bilecik.

872
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,560
We cannot put Osman Bey alone.

873
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,440
Do you think I didn't think of that?

874
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,200
Besides, I sent my alps to Kayı Oba.

875
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,224
From there they will pass to Bilecik.

876
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,880
I took my precaution.

877
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:12,840
But whatever happens.

878
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,880
Those who intend to kill Osman Bey.

879
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,904
Söğüt will not be empty.

880
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,560
It is the property of Söğüt Türk.

881
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,280
Leaving it headless.

882
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,920
is cruel to us.

883
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,640
For this reason.

884
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,920
I'll take over the administration of Söğüt.

885
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,880
Barkin Bey says the truth.

886
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,960
This is to oppose Osman Bey.

887
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,080
I do not accept this.

888
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,320
But I'm here to increase the precaution in Söğüt.

889
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,680
Taking over is unacceptable.

890
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:48,800
Gentlemen.

891
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,560
Osman Bey is closer to me than any of you.

892
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,160
But.

893
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,680
rather than being homeless.

894
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,280
I will have to manage Söğüt.

895
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,040
Headless home.

896
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,000

898
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:11,920
Now.

899
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,200
you say.

900
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,000
Osman Bey said no.

901
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,560
Should the Turkish flag fall to the ground?

902
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,960
Surely someone will come out.

903
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,680
he will raise the banner.

905
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,004
Bark, where are you?.

906
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:46,640
You lied to the gentlemen.

907
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,840
You didn't release an Alp to Obama.

908
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,000
There is no excuse for what you did.

909

910
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,720
Assign.

911
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,080

914
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,000
That Osman will fall victim to his arrogance.

ten innocent alis.

916
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,800
Shall I leave it to the mercy of the unbeliever?

Thanks.

It is iftar time.

922
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,400
Ohhh.

When will we depart, sir?

We are waiting for them all to come together.

Damn.

They're gone.

935
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,240
Quickly search the castle.

936

Where are you going?.

You go to the cellar to get these pusats.

[Music is playing].

942
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:34,040
What are you looking for here?

943
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,000
We found what we were looking for.

you will manage.

948
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,800

Even if we are in the middle of the war.

956
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,280
You need to break the fast.

957
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,920
Our mouths were undone.

958
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,880
Here you are.

959
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,120
Come on.

Insiders, open the door.

Soldiers come out of every hole.

969
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,040
Obviously, the sentence from fear is Tekfur.

970
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,400
They have piled up their soldiers here.

971
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,600
Let the heartless pile up.

If David was a Master.

Good eye, Justinian.

it's coming and going.

I've had a man after them dozens of times.

1001
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,880
I followed and but.

1002
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,320
I couldnt find it.

1003
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:30,560
That they put their headquarters here.

1004
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:34,040
very, very interesting.

1005
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,920
Because he's going to die tonight.

Then too.

1010
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,920
the catapults he made to demolish my walls.

1011

You gave your mine.

1015
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,600
But now you'll get it back in full.

1016
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:18,240

This land tonight.

What will happen to me?

1025

Don't cry, beautiful girl.

1026
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,304
Oh, don't cry.

1027

He saved you from those bastards.

Now he will send you to your aunt.

Do not be afraid, my beautiful girl.

You are very good people.

Are you okay?.

The color of his face is gone.

1036
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,240
Zehra, run and get water.

1037
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,248
Mother.

1038

1040
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:15,760
It's old age.

1041

My breath goes away.

1042
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:22,720
Zehra.

1043
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:25,880
You take Holofira to the tent.

1044

Have a good sleep, come on girl.

1045

You're not good.

Let's see a healer.

Ayşe.

1051
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,520
I know my time is running out.

1052
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,544
How does my mother say that?.

1053
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:55,960
Let me go to this dove abdal.

1054
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,200
Oh girl sit down.

1055
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,640
Sit down.

1056
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,560
I did my best.

1057
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,840
Other than that, it's divine.

1058
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,000
But my wish.

1059
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,680
I'm Osman.

1063
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,720
I've waited so long for this victory, my daughter.

01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:19,760
my mother.

1065
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,000
My beautiful mother.

1066
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,040
Don't do it to me, please don't do this.

1067
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,560
I'm Osman.

1068
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:29,240
It does not suit me to die without returning with victory.

1069
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,600
You all listen to me well.

1070
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,720
If I can't stand it.

1071
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,720
There are bundles in the coffin.

1072
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,840
You will give it to my grandchildren.

1073
01:24:44,864 --> 01:24:45,960
He?.

1074
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:47,040
Mother.

1075
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:51,880
Mother.

[Music is playing].

1077
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,620
Oh my goodness babes.

1078

oh my god.

1079

Those who want to bury us this castle.

1080
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,480
Let's break their game.

1081
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:23,000
But.

1082
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,680
I don't like to shed blood with the disbeliever's purse.

1083
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:39,040
It is safe.

1084
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,160
I fall.

1085
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,640
puss does not fall.

1086
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,720
To get this puss from me.

1087
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,744
they need to cut off my arms.

1088
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,680
Pusat lives longer than Adam Cerkutay.

1089
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,760
Bamsı Bey's pusats.

1090
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,320
he has seen many wars.

1091

Masallah.

1092

It's your trust.

1093
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:01,560
you watch it.

1094
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:03,800
Are my arms?

1095
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,320
You give your right.

1096
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,000
Especially let Bilecik military see your enthusiasm.

1097
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,000
They will surrender the fort without a fight.

1098
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,760
haha.

1099
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,120
I was a good warrior, Gündüz Bey.

1100
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:17,240
I know Cerkutay.

1101
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:19,264
But.

1102
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,120
I learned about Cenki gaza from you.

1103
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,720
The right path is rough.

1104
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,160
There is martyrdom.

1105
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,120
Hani Cerkutay would not have died.

1106
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,240
Pusat.

1107
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,420
from Adam.

long live Gunduz Bey.

01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,560
I also have these relics.

1110
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,584
I will pass it on to my son Kaya.

1111
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,240
You become soil.

1112
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,400
I will be soil

1113
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,640
Conquerors die.

1114
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:55,160
but conquests.

01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,800
be inherited from generations.

1116
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,680
Our cause.

1117
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:01,704
Cerkutay is longer than life.

1118
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:02,480
Come on.

1119
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,360
Until it's earth.

1120
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,600
whatever disbeliever we reap is profit.

1121
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,560
Let's be blessed.

01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,584
Come on. Come on. Come on.

Trap.

What is that nett?.

1127
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,280

[Music is playing].

1319
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:59,120
You take them all to the dungeon.

1320
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,440
on the moon.

1321
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:20,480

1322
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,000
Thank you sir.

1323
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,760
Thank god.

[Music is playing].

1325
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:01,040
Is there a Destur, my Barkın Bey?

1326
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:01,840
come on.

1327
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:12,600
[Music is playing].

1328
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,040
Here you go guys.

1329
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,920
What brought you here?

1330
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:19,440
We are against taking Söğüt.

1331
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:21,720
If you try it.

1332
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,744
Our Alps are Pusats.

1333
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:26,080
it won't hold back from your neck.

1334
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:34,720
[Music is playing].

1335
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:35,600
To you.

1336
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,080
I said why am I doing this?

1337
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,040
But.

1338
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:46,064
you didn't understand.

1339
01:48:46,420 --> 01:49:00,660
[Music is playing].

1340
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:08,560
[Music is playing].

1341
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,600
At that time.

1342
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:11,624
I said lie.

1343
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,360
Let me say the truth.

1344
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,680
Osman will die.

1345
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:22,704
The willow will be mine.

1346
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,160
It will be mine.

1347
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,000
Is there a Destur, sir?

1348
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:33,160
come on.

1349
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:42,640
Sir.

1350
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:44,840
The master is waiting for you.

[Music is playing].

1352
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,800
Do not bury them without anyone seeing them.

1353

[Music is playing].

1354
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:33,200
Selamun aleykum.

1355
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:56,804
My loyalty.

1356
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,480
And aleykum Selam Akça.

1357
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:02,760
Here you go.

1358
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,640
It's for sahur, my Sheikh.

1359
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:13,520
To leave a single sahur tray.

1360
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,800
It's obvious you didn't come, Akçam.

1361
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,800
The one that landed on your heart.

1362
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,240
say it in your language.

1363
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:26,080
[Music is playing].

1364
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,040
thank you.

1365
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,600
Bilecik castle.

1366

biased from the evening prayer.

1367
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,720
He is a warrior, my Sheikh.

1368
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,960
Do we have any information?

1369
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:42,000
The souls came and blew in our ears, my Sheikh.

1370
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:44,800
Mr. Osman.

1371
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:49,040
He won the victory with Bilecik castle, my Sheikh.

1372
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,280
Thank you to this victor.

1373

1374
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:07,400
With our guest Koses.

1375
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,320
May you be closely interested, Akçam.

1376
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:12,640
Don't miss a thing.

1377
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:13,760
Also.

1378
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,880
from the holy Quran.

1379
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:18,904
May our guest be blessed too.

1380
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:21,520
If he wishes.

1381
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,544
read the Qur'an next to you.

1382
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:26,200
Thank you, Sheikh.

1383
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:27,880
Thanks.

[Music is playing].

1385
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:40,200
Is this the job, huh?

1386
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:47,380
[Music is playing].

1387
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:49,600
Unable to control his anger.

1388
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:52,000
Nikola is doomed to defeat.

1389
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:53,680
to be strong.

1390
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:56,080
to direct your anger at your enemy.

1391
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,104
Not for yourself.

1392
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,128
This was the end.

1393
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:04,760
This was the end.

1394
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:07,920
This was the end.

1395
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:09,944
Be patient, Nikola.

1396
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:11,160
Be patient.

1397
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:13,184
Shall I be patient, Master Arius?

1398
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,060
All this time apart from being patient.

1399
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:16,160
What else did I do?

1400
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,200
I am patient.

1401
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,120
Now this patience is rewarded.

1402
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:20,120
Isn't it time?

1403
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,680
Osman's.

1404
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,640
Gathered to conquer İnegöl.

1405
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:25,400
destroy the ammunition.

1406
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,060
Your patience will be greatly rewarded, Nikola.

1407
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:31,084
I don't want to wait a single moment.

1408
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:34,240
I will not sleep without hurting Osman.

1409
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:37,040
Then you won't be sleep deprived much.

1410
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,064
Because it's our first job.

1411
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:41,280
it will be to destroy the headquarters.

1412
01:53:41,280 --> 01:54:04,560
[Music is playing].

1413
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:06,000
You wanted me, sir.

1414
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:17,800
[Music is playing].

1415
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,760
What did Osman Bey do?

1416
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,920
He made Bilecik a home for the Turks.

1417
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,760
What did Osman Bey do?

1418
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:28,160
He cut off my tyrant's arm.

1419
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,000
What did Osman Bey do?

1420
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,024
He saved his children.

1421
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,320
What did Osman Bey do?

1422
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,000
He opened the door of Bilecik to us.

1423
01:54:37,100 --> 01:54:38,280
Allahu Akbar.

1424
01:54:38,280 --> 01:55:00,620
Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar.

1425
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:05,640
On this blessed night of Ramadan.

1426
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:09,000
who gave us such a conquest.

1427
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:12,120
Praise be to the Almighty Lord.

1428
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:19,960
Bilecik castle.

1429
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:22,880
It is the property of the nonTurk.

1430
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:34,060
Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar.

1431
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,640
Can we do sahur here too, sir?

1432
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:40,664
We will.

1433
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:46,200
More beautiful property.

1434
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:47,880
all together.

1435
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:49,440
our sahur.

1436
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:51,464
I hope we will also have our iftar.

1437
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:52,640
Hopefully.

1438
01:55:52,680 --> 01:56:03,080
[Music is playing].

1439
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:04,560
Bilecik castle.

1440
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:08,600
God willing.

1441
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,180
forever.

1442
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:12,920
It is the property of Turks and Islam.

1443
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:43,300
[Music is playing].

1444
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:45,640
The Turkish flag will fly.

1445
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:50,480
And the voice of our prayers will never be silenced.

1446
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:53,360
Our iftar.

1447
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:57,140
and we will make our sahur in this land.

1448
01:56:57,940 --> 01:56:59,000
guards.

1449
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:02,240
valiant ones.

1450
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:05,520
The road is tough.

1451
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:09,240
But you didn't hesitate.

1452
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:11,800
You exist.

1453
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,840
You have always been with us.

1454
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:18,320
And you made the conquest even easier.

1455
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:26,520
[Music is playing].

1456
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:27,600
girls.

1457
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,800
You have always stood behind me.

1458
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:34,720
You may exist.

1459
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:36,200
We stopped.

1460
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,520
We don't want to stand still.

1461
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,160
We want to run from conquest to conquest.

1462
01:57:46,660 --> 01:57:48,000
You won't stop.

1463
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,320
As long as we have enough.

1464
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:53,480
We will always dream of more.

1465
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:54,920
I hope Mr.

1466
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:57,920
We will raise our children with this dream.

1467
01:57:58,420 --> 01:57:59,520
Hopefully.

1468
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:06,680
Our destination is İnegöl.

1469
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:08,704
This Friday.

1470
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:11,040
In front of the Inegol city walls.

1471
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:13,320
together we will keep it pure.

1472
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,560
And hopefully.

1473
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:18,360
We will open our iftar in İnegöl.

1474
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,160
It is a time of conquest.

1475
01:58:22,660 --> 01:58:24,000
Bilecik castle.

1476
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:26,640
It is Turkish property.

1477
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:29,600
But.

1478
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:33,040
you will never forget.

1479
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:36,920
We are custodians.

1480
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:41,160
The property belongs only to Allah.

1481
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:44,800
We will fight for him.

1482
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,080
We will conquer for him.

1483
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:53,420
the word of God.

1484
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,600
until there is nowhere left for him to reach.

1485
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,780
Allhu Akbar.

1486
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:26,320
Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar.

1487
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:28,000
Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar.

1488

Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar.

1491
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:14,240
[Music is playing].

1492
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:15,800
Sheikh Edibala.

1493
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,480
while you are fasting like this.

1494
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:22,080
Drinking this soup is not my thing.

1495
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:23,780
I guess it won't fit me.

1496
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:27,480
You will, Koses.

1497
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,320
It is for healing.

1498
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,200
You know, Islam.

1499
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:35,880
human life.

1500
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:37,640
prioritizes everything.

1501
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:40,760
For the health of your soul.

1502
