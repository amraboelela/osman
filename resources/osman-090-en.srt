1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:59,668
[Generic].

2
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,472
sons.

3
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:03,816
This is the İnegöl Castle you see.

4
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,596
Look at the eyice, eyice.

5
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,196
Because we will walk there first.

6
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:23,211
After that, the Monk Mountains.

7
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:26,738
There is Bursa, where he stretches his arms.

8
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:29,358
After him to Konstantinini.

9
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,066
and after that the sentence is cihan.

10
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,680
This case that I took over from my Ancestor.

11
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,446
You will pass it on to your children.

12
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:52,720
And they, too, will pass it on to their children.

13
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:58,466
We will become a state.

14
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:03,961
Neither our expedition will end, nor our war will end.

15
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:06,867
my sons.

16
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:11,788
We were born on horseback, we will die on horseback.

17
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:17,207
The horse is our will. The horse is the wing of the Turk.

18
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:19,853
And.

19
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:25,146
When we ride horses, we always go forward.

20
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,544
Our essence is longing for the influx.

21
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:32,409
Our face is always turned towards conquest.

22
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:37,208
It is the two wings that carry us forward.

23
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:45,307
Orhan, you say, what is one of that wing?

24
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,098
Order of the world is a case, father.

25
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:50,869
Ordinance is the case of the world.

26
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:56,787
It is to make the order of Allah dominate the world.

27
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:03,902
Let Alaeddin say, what is the other wing of that wing?

28
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,507
The divine word is Allah, father.

29
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:09,519
That's right, that's why we steal our pusats.

30
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:12,129
That's why we kick our horses.

31
00:05:14,243 --> 00:05:17,417
And our cause is the cause of rights.

32
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,950
Until the world is judged with justice.

33
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,487
until there is not a single soul of the oppressed.

34
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:28,871
We will breathe in the neck of the oppressors.

35
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:31,415
sons.

36
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,016
Let's ride at full bridle for our dreams.

37
00:05:48,903 --> 00:06:28,897
[Music is playing].

38
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,791
Where will the corridors lead, father?

39
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,836
At the end of every narrowness there is an exit.

40
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:46,027
The important thing is to know the way.

41
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,567
If you know the way you shouldn't worry, but if you don't know.

42
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,642
Then you will take action.

43
00:06:59,454 --> 00:07:00,697
Storm.

44
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:02,852
Sir, come.

45
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:06,428
Come on.

46
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:07,958
Thank you sir.

47
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,271
Come on.

48
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:32,408
sons.

49
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,387
Where is this place, dad?

50
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:30,326
It is the beginning of the road to conquest, my Orhan.

51
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:37,190
It is the den of horses whose hearts are burned with a conquest.

52
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,547
Come easy.

53
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,527
[Thank you, thank you Sir].

54
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,254
Thank you, thank you.

55
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,796
Selamunaleykum, take it easy.

56
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:10,727
Aleykum salam.

57
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:12,727
You are welcome, Mr.

58
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,054
We welcome you, master David.

59
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,054
Welcome, my princes.

60
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:18,854
Welcome, master David.

61
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:21,288
Be there, master David.

62
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,902
Let me tell you, what is the mood?.

63
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:26,233
Here you go, sir.

64
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:34,282
I did all the calculations, sir.

65
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:39,464
The catapults will be lined up like this, they will beat the walls.

66
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:42,613
I hope they will smash the door to the ground.

67
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,664
What about master David?

68
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:56,632
Will these catapults have enough range?

69
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:00,604
It will be enough, by the grace of God, sir.

70
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,609
Maybe there is a reverse wind blowing.

71
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:08,123
the cannonballs on these catapults are upon us.

72
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:10,123
or it will not fall in front of us, right?.

73
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,933
I knew you would ask this question, Mr.

74
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:18,182
Alhamdulillah, I strengthened the cannonballs against the wind.

75
00:10:19,815 --> 00:10:22,216
The angels of Allah are in the hands of badrin.

76
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:24,442
if he helps us as he helped.

77
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,016
I hope no wind can stop us.

78
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:29,765
Hopefully, hopefully.

79
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,363
If we have faith like the lions of Bedrin.

80
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:37,813
At that time, the army of angels will certainly be on our side.

81
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,748
Isn't it, mullah Alaeddin?

82
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:41,650
What a need for the right word, sir.

83
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:43,384
oh my god.

84
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,155
Mashallah my brave.

85
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:55,556
sir.

86
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,373
sons.

87
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:11,264
Let's just say it is put.

88
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:12,706
sir.

89
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,372
Jarid whistling at your command gathers intelligence.

90
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:19,286
It is now in İnegöl.

91
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:23,164
Bearing pusat lorum fire from Konstantinini.

92
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:25,579
a unit was about to arrive in İnegöl.

93
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:30,871
But the summons says if we don't stop the caravan….

94
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:33,751
He says that during the conquest of the castle, there will be a big problem.

95
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:38,693
Nikola the Jackal.

96
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:42,069
Then we will hit fast.

97
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:46,241
Doesn't hitting the caravan break the peace, sir?

98
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:57,355
There is a pusat in that caravan, my prince.

99
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:00,866
What if they try to declare war on us, saying we hit the caravan?

100
00:12:01,908 --> 00:12:05,169
He becomes guilty first because he has piled up ammunition in his castle.

101
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,071
Nikola won't even be able to understand what's going on.

102
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:14,527
We'll fall on you like lightning.

103
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:18,321
Well, he won't even be able to chase after you.

104
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,395
We also want to come to the gas, Mr.

105
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:32,134
It is your right, of course.

106
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,734
But you are not yet skilled enough to go to war.

107
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:40,059
Especially prove yourself on the hunt.

108
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,188
Then I say you are ready for war.

109
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:47,452
Thank you sir.

110
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,088
At that time, we also have to hunt.

111
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:57,794
Do not come back emptyhanded.

112
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:02,236
Beware.

113
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,137
It's your command, sir.

114
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:08,000
Baysungur.

115
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,664
sir.

116
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:10,500
Come on.

117
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:24,830
Sir, what about the willow bull?

118
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:27,151
Well, we don't go emptyhanded.

119
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:31,267
But, I'll go ahead of time and make room for the raid.

120
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,813
Don't be late either.

121
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,436
Sir, let's be with one of us.

122
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:41,388
Just give me a chance.

123
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,861
I will ride alone.

124
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,548
This looks like a precious piece of cloth, Simon.

125
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,948
Dear sir, of very precious Chinese silk.

126
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,784
It is a very old fabric from the Sassanids.

127
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:21,921
In western Rome they use it to cover saints.

128
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,743
Am I a saint, Simon?

129
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,786
The burial of the deceased saints is draped over it.

130
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:32,650
You are before me like an ancient statue.

131
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:35,800
You deserve this more.

132
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:56,912
When will he come?.

133
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:59,018
On the way, sir.

134
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,184
We have a peace agreement with Osman You know, right Simon?

135
00:15:04,184 --> 00:15:05,847
This ammunition came and went.

136
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:09,262
No one should know where he is.

137
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:10,762
Did you understand?.

138
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:11,805
I calculated everything.

139
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:13,291
Don't worry, sir.

140
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You will be like a shadow, Simon.

141
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,943
No one will see, know, recognize you.

142
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:24,979
Tekfurs will come soon, even they should not know who you are.

143
00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:31,204
Now take your saint cloths and go.

144
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,016
Best regards.

145
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,593
Don't linger, Simon, don't linger.

146
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:06,990
Selamunaleyküm valiants.

147
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:09,646
And hello, Gence Bey.

148
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:12,853
Wow Gence, you're welcome.

149
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,000
Hey, my Orhan, are you okay?

150
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,200
Thanks God.

151
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,759
oh my god.

152
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:25,048
You're fine, master David.

153
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,985
Praise be to my valiant, you are good too.

154
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,485
Thank you, thank you.

155
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,637
And aleyküküm, you have been absent for a long time, where are you?.

156
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:39,109
We are also in Gardash, in Shusha, in Karabakh.

157
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,109
We overcame the infested kelp.

158
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:43,138
Thank you very much, thank you very much.

159
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
Who is this valiant?

160
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,881
I am a Caucasian Turk. My name is Shamil.

161
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,475
I heard that Osman Bey has waved the jihad flag.

162
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:55,475
That's why I said I can't be blessed.

163
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,260
You are welcome.

164
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:02,444
You are a lucky man, Shamil gardaş.

165
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:04,977
We'll go on an expedition with the dust of your feet.

166
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:07,156
Thank you Lord.

167
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:08,818
Thanks.

168
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:23,562
Check it out babes eyice so that there is no gap.

169
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:28,209
These are the special orders of the Bilecik Tekfur.

170
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:40,156
O mashallah, its color shines like the sky.

171
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:43,427
Even my eyes can see the beauty of color.

172
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,393
Well done ladies, it's very nice.

173
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:54,924
Come easy ladies.

174
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,511
Thank you Malhun Hatun.

175
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,618
Aygul.

176
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,502
They are the best goods.

177
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:05,304
They've completed it all.

178
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:07,283
Masallah.

179
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,538
Look at my mother, she is at work again.

180
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:18,598
One cannot breathe.

181
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,384
He starts work at sunrise in the morning.

182
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,613
May Allah increase your strength.

183
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:26,584
Amine.

184
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:28,559
Amen, amen.

185
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,572
It can't be said, but his pain has increased from person to person.

186
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,615
He used to go to the healer and rub his back.

187
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh my beautiful mother.

188
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:49,088
honey.

189
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,772
What would we do without you?

190
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:53,401
My Bala, my beautiful daughter, what have you done?

191
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:56,977
What did my children do, did you find out?.

192
00:18:56,977 --> 00:19:00,000
They went on a training with their parents.

193
00:19:06,632 --> 00:19:08,228
Hey go days hey.

194
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,700
My husband Ertuğrul Gazi too.

195
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:16,307
He used to train my Osman like this.

196
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:21,714
He made a memory of shooting, he taught the enemy to set an ambush.

197
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:27,721
I have few breaths left in this world.

198
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:31,950
My main advice to you is; 'Hand your children.

199
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,928
Like privates, you can raise your angel girls like women.

200
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,555
It is the greatest legacy of mother and father.

201
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,022
raising good children.

202
00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:48,926
Look, Osman.

203
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:53,006
What happened to Ertuğrul Gazi's hearth?

204
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:56,813
He grew up, now with my Orhan.

205
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:00,000
My Alaeddin will enlarge your hearth.

206
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,884
Hopefully.

207
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,101
Hopefully.

208
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:09,992
These wars, from my son to his crusader.

209
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:11,602
Our girls made us very tired.

210
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:15,571
E enough nonMuslims suffered.

211
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:19,036
Now for better days.

212
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,623
your biggest task.

213
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:25,430
Raise good children, emi.

214
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:30,879
Let's go to work.

[Music is playing].

216
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:47,521
My Lord, my Lord, you attach the conquest to the conquest in me.

217
00:21:47,521 --> 00:21:50,064
damn, dear.

218
00:21:50,064 --> 00:21:56,395
My Lord, you put your paper clip on the conquest inside of me.

219
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:57,814
oh my God.

220
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:10,702
Grant me victories.

221
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:14,334
Grant me conquests.

222
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:17,718
Amen, my Lord.

223
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:21,676
Amen, my Lord.

224
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:37,481
sir.

225
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:42,221
I come from the İnegöl market, Simon brings the goods.

226
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,317
They will come after Yeşilbayır soon.

227
00:22:47,585 --> 00:22:51,222
Good, let's see, let's see.

228
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:58,660
Sir, their arrival is nice, it is also nice.

229
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,639
Where are our Alps?.

230
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,023
Yoo Bey, to the big caravan.

231
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:11,762
Are we both going to ambush?

232
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,688
What if it's Cerkutay, are you scared?

233
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:19,281
I was on my way trusting you.

234
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:25,640
Thank you sir, let's die, let's die?.

235
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,000
Where is my old Cerkutay?

236
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,717
The years have aged you so much.

237
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:36,161
Where is that valiant Cerkutay?

238
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:38,598
Where is that crazy Cerkutay?

239
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:42,109
My lord, I'll be lightning alone on your hills.

240
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:44,109
I will go down, my Bey. You trust me and go.

241
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:47,046
You're out, I'll make this world narrow for them.

242
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:53,040
Oh, this is my mashallah Cerkutay.

[Music is playing].

244
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:07,959
Come on, you go.

245

It's your command, sir.

246
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,994
Have a nice trip.

247

Threes, sevens, forty's sake.

Are you ready for Azaya?

255
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,336
We exist.

We exist.

258

What is Aza for?

259
00:25:14,217 --> 00:25:16,338
Consent is for right.

260
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:18,450
Are you ready to become a veteran?

261
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,381
Hallelujah.

262
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:23,610
Are you ready to drink the sherbet of Shahada?

263

Allahu Akbar.

264

Allahu Akbar.

Allah is Ever-Living.

268
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,283
To be frank.

269
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:50,283
At first, I never wanted peace.

270
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:51,816
Come see.

271

we eat the fruit the most.

272
00:25:55,702 --> 00:25:58,016
We are doing good business with Osman.

273
00:25:58,294 --> 00:26:00,608
It will bring me a lot of goods very soon.

274
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:03,915
I'm sure you can trade with us.

275
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,916
for not hitting our caravans.

276
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:07,684
he's going crazy.

277
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:12,920
I don't even want to hear Osman's name.

278
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,267
Why?.

279
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:17,695
Aren't you an old friend?

280
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:20,718
Unfortunately, old friends can also become enemies.

basileus

282
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Nicola is a close witness.

283
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:29,956
Our swords clashed a lot with Osman.

284
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:31,649
But still human.

285
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:33,020
from his own blood.

286
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:34,973
from his own faith.

287
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:37,106
one of his own religion.

288
00:26:37,106 --> 00:26:38,801
He sees himself closer.

290
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,683
Even if Kosses is late.

291

turned from his mistake.

292

we can say.

293
00:26:50,997 --> 00:26:53,469
Anyway, those nasty issues.

294
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,473
Let's put it aside.

295
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:01,377

I think he's talking about the Turks.

325

Dear Basileus, we are already in this land.

326
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,045
We have lived in peace with the Turks for many years.

327
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,492
Is not it?.

328
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:17,099
Like that.

This is the bond between us at the wedding.

330

Because all the preparations.

370
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:48,252
I'm in a bit of a hurry now.

00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:57,719
[Music is playing].

372
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:31,142

373
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:33,030
Come on, talk.

[Music is playing].

375
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:50,197
My dear friends.

376
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,075
It will be an unforgettable wedding.

377
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:53,828
It will be great.

378
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:55,035
Osman's head is the most valuable of the wedding.

379
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:56,171
It will be a gift.

380
00:33:56,171 --> 00:33:57,432
Not just Osman.

381
00:33:58,238 --> 00:34:00,395
I hope his family comes with him.

382
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:03,385
My stepdaughter Holofira and.

383
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:07,353
Tekfur of Bilecik Justinyanus is getting married.

384
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,553
The death of Osman and his family.

385
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:14,145
This will be the greatest gift of the wedding.

386
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:15,486
Not just Osman.

387
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,193
Gündüz, Turgut, his women, his children.

388
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:19,361
big ones, small ones.

389
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:21,323
Whoever it is, they will all die.

390
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:22,496
And all of them.

391
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,573
Just one person from this carnage.

392
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,314
only one will survive.

393
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:29,395
He is Barkin.

394
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:30,834
Barkin?.

395
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:33,551
[Music is playing].

396
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:35,551
You trust Barkin.

397
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:36,764
I understand that.

398
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:39,878
Well, do you trust Kosses?

399
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,400
[Music is playing].

400
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,343
Kosses is a very old friend of mine.

401
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:49,104
And that I shouldn't trust him.

402
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:51,073
long enough to know.

403
00:34:51,073 --> 00:34:52,872
I know him Basileus.

404
00:34:55,308 --> 00:34:56,294
What are we gonna do?.

405
00:34:57,448 --> 00:34:58,741
What are we gonna do?.

406
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:01,799
Kosses has not met Osman all this time.

407
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,275
But still Osman.

408
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:04,456
against in such a.

00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,256
love.

410
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:08,872
There is love.

411
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:10,781
We have to take this into account.

412
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,105
Therefore.

413
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:16,642
to end the war before it begins.

414
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:18,094
a small price.

415
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:19,900
Just before the wedding.

416
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:24,179
Kosses will die.

Caravan head.

Your path ends here.

420
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:50,083
No.

421
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,584
Our road ends in İnegöl.

422
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:57,822
Are you saying so?.

423
00:35:58,233 --> 00:35:59,607
You have a peace treaty.

424
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:01,371
These roads belong to all of us.

425
00:36:01,371 --> 00:36:04,006
But if you value your life.

426
00:36:04,006 --> 00:36:05,613
get out of our way.

427
00:36:05,613 --> 00:36:07,254
Your goods and your life.

it is at our disposal.

429
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,802
Something that I can solve by fighting.

430
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,393
I don't waste my time talking.

431
00:36:16,572 --> 00:36:17,393
Soldiers.

432
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,241
Turkish blood should not be shed.

433
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:20,534
it's been a long time.

434
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:21,673
Attack.

Come here.

443
00:38:02,705 --> 00:38:04,941
Where are you running away from leaving your ammunition?

444
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:08,753
So you're bringing a pusat to shoot the Turk.

445
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:13,165
Is your aim to break the peace?

446
00:38:14,153 --> 00:38:15,839
But it's the only place you can escape to.

447
00:38:16,746 --> 00:38:18,510
is my wrath.

448
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:20,825
kill me.

449
00:38:21,458 --> 00:38:22,436
Kill.

No.

451

No.

452
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:27,107
You will live.

453
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,493
And to Nikola.

454
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:32,825
You will say that I shot the caravan.

455
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,133
If that.

456
00:38:35,952 --> 00:38:37,952
if breaking the peace counts.

457
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:40,445
then tell him

I also use these pusats as evidence.

Hopefully.

473

What did our glorious Mohammed say?

00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,734
'He who sleeps while his neighbor is hungry is not one of us'.

475

May Allah make us among the believers.

But.

00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:33,337
Of course, we have not been idle all this time.

We have enlarged our base.

Our pacts got sharper.

560
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,630
We did not do what you said, Osman Bey.

561
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,351
Tekfurs did it too.

562
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:51,345
It got stronger.

563
00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:53,884
I heard that Nikola is massing soldiers in the villages.

564
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:56,933
Caravans were coming.

565
00:46:57,304 --> 00:46:59,304
Pusati also soldiers for sale.

566
00:46:59,304 --> 00:47:00,757
He was invited to his castle.

567
00:47:01,116 --> 00:47:03,116
War is near, sir.

568
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,016
Don't be far.

569
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:07,871
Let it come.

570
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:10,356
If there is a fire, it will burn as much as a crime.

571
00:47:10,905 --> 00:47:12,434
You say now.

572
00:47:13,023 --> 00:47:14,473
Aren't you stronger?

573
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:18,805
Didn't your trade increase when peace was established?

574
00:47:21,598 --> 00:47:22,891
It did not increase.

575
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,757
At that time.

576
00:47:25,497 --> 00:47:26,711
You look at Barkin Bey.

577
00:47:28,165 --> 00:47:30,558
His treasury has surpassed all of us.

578
00:47:31,706 --> 00:47:35,042
You will see that you will receive inspiration from him.

579
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:40,161
[Music is playing].

580
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:41,619
Mashallah Mr. Barkin.

581
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:43,176
Masallah.

582
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,077
Estagfurullah Turgut Bey.

583
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:49,771
Our property too.

584
00:47:50,433 --> 00:47:51,411
our souls too.

585
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,037
It is a sacrifice for the Turkish fortune.

586
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:55,869
Thanks.

587
00:48:25,864 --> 00:48:27,314
Where are you going?.

588
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,008
See also this.

589
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,439
a few Turkmen children.

590
00:48:40,886 --> 00:48:42,493
Get out of our way.

591
00:48:44,528 --> 00:48:45,881
Of course I will leave.

592
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:50,773
But the lady next to you is coming with us.

593
00:48:54,392 --> 00:48:54,992
All the guys in one little girl.

594
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:56,706
you are chasing.

595
00:48:56,706 --> 00:48:58,166
Is this fair?

596
00:48:58,831 --> 00:49:00,438
The girl doesn't want to come with you.

597
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,742
Then he will come with us.

598
00:49:01,742 --> 00:50:00,001
[Music is playing].

599
00:50:00,001 --> 00:50:02,001
We do not give shelter to us.

600
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:04,522
You can't get it past us.

601
00:50:04,522 --> 00:50:07,849
[Music is playing].

602
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:09,849
I don't have time to play games, brats.

603
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:20,155
[Music is playing].

604
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:22,339
Counting on your only remaining arrow?

605
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:24,650
[Music is playing].

606
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,658
I will bury you in this forest.

607
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:27,994
Soldiers.

608
00:50:27,994 --> 00:51:03,067
[Music is playing].

609
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,072
Come on.

610

[Music is playing].

611
00:51:19,632 --> 00:51:22,025
You've done your best now.

612
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:24,815
But now I have to go with them.

613
00:51:25,263 --> 00:51:26,163
Impossible.

614
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:27,535
We do not allow this.

615
00:51:27,535 --> 00:51:55,235
[Music is playing].

616
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:58,675
If you raise your hand, you will see the arrow in your head.

617
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,200
You will give an account.

618
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:09,011
[Music is playing].

619
00:52:09,011 --> 00:52:09,848
God.

[Music is playing].

621
00:52:17,738 --> 00:52:19,738
May you exist, Baysungur Alp.

622
00:52:19,738 --> 00:52:21,738
Oh my goodness Baysungur Alp.

623
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,040
You arrived just in time.

624
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:54,156
[Music is playing].

625
00:52:54,156 --> 00:52:56,549
There is no further step away.

626
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:01,046
You saw what happened to you.

627
00:53:10,013 --> 00:53:12,249
God forbid, what if we couldn't catch up?

628
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:13,624
He?.

629
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:15,700
What would I say to my Bey then?

630
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,714
Just say it.

631
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,398
We're fine.

632
00:53:18,927 --> 00:53:19,905
Thank god.

633
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:25,104
What is your name?.

634
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:27,104
Why were you running from the soldiers?

635
00:53:28,268 --> 00:53:30,268
What do you keep questioning like Münker Nekir?

636
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:31,665
Let a girl breathe.

637
00:53:32,758 --> 00:53:34,758
If I'm not mistaken, they are Tekfur's soldiers.

638
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:36,759
It won't be very good when my father hears about it.

639
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:39,723
You know, brother, there is peace between us.

640
00:53:44,457 --> 00:53:47,793
Come on, we'll talk about the rest when we get to the camp.

641
00:53:48,988 --> 00:53:50,281
It's not just here.

642
00:53:51,054 --> 00:53:51,797
Alps.

643
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,487
Prepare the horses.

644
00:53:54,322 --> 00:53:55,065
Lets.

645
00:53:55,065 --> 00:54:10,306
[Music is playing].

646
00:54:10,307 --> 00:54:12,464
But remember.

647
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,000
water sleeps.

648
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,026
but the enemy does not sleep.

649
00:54:18,026 --> 00:54:23,133
[Music is playing].

650
00:54:23,133 --> 00:54:24,802
Of course they will be prepared.

651
00:54:24,802 --> 00:54:30,384
[Music is playing].

652
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:31,912
At your command.

653
00:54:32,892 --> 00:54:35,363
We have been establishing markets all over the world for years.

654
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,750
We will grow our trade, Mr.

655
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,921
But.

656
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:41,927
in the slightest confusion.

657
00:54:43,106 --> 00:54:45,207
We do not have the power to protect these markets.

658
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,242
The settlement agreement continues.

659
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:53,357
Markets and order.

660
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:55,358
We protect it with a peace agreement.

661
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:58,391
Don't mess with our markets.

662
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,432
We will continue to protect it with the peace text.

663
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:06,707
[Music is playing].

664
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:07,921
Mr. Barkin.

665
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:10,554
Let's say, what is the number of horses?.

666
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:14,450
In such a war, as the Akca dervish said.

667
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:16,657
enough to protect our markets.

668
00:55:16,657 --> 00:55:17,728
Don't we have Alpine?

669
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,936
There are many valiant, sir.

670
00:55:20,345 --> 00:55:23,445
However, drill is not equal to battle.

671
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,180
We are afraid that the henna will rust.

672
00:55:26,605 --> 00:55:28,369
How do we get rusty?

673
00:55:30,373 --> 00:55:31,901
nor do we die in the tent.

674
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,794
Your Alps will always be ready.

675
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:40,609
The drills are tough.

676
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:42,771
their wrists will be of steel.

677
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:45,000
Gentlemen.

678
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,706
Not only Barkın Bey.

679
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:50,141
yours too, gentlemen.

680
00:55:50,628 --> 00:55:51,685
Yours too.

681
00:55:53,198 --> 00:55:55,670
Because you sweat a lot in peace.

682
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,174
less blood flows in battle.

683
00:56:01,014 --> 00:56:02,700
Not just your men.

684
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:05,509
You will also prepare your sisters.

685
00:56:07,857 --> 00:56:09,266
As you mentioned.

686
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,486
if there will be a battle.

687
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:14,582
then we will be ready.

688
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:17,048
But.

689
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:20,029
Now the settlement agreement continues.

690
00:56:24,945 --> 00:56:27,181
But we will not be the ones who break the contract.

691
00:56:35,311 --> 00:56:37,390
Hey go Kaya Obasi.

692
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:42,003
When the children left, we remained silent.

693
00:56:43,348 --> 00:56:45,000
But it's almost time, my mother.

694
00:56:45,587 --> 00:56:46,644
When we send the goods to Bilecik.

695
00:56:46,644 --> 00:56:49,116
I hope we will follow you to the plateau.

696
00:56:51,053 --> 00:56:53,603
Did the kids really not come back yet?.

697
00:56:53,603 --> 00:56:54,957
No, I did not see.

698
00:56:55,526 --> 00:56:57,290
If they had come, they would have heard.

699
00:56:57,723 --> 00:56:59,094
Have you seen Aygul?

700
00:56:59,094 --> 00:57:00,000
They are with Osman Bey.

701
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,753
It was the hunt, they're late for the drill.

702
00:57:04,428 --> 00:57:07,057
As I see my Orhan, my Alaeddin.

703
00:57:07,862 --> 00:57:09,862
the fire in my heart grows stronger.

704
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:13,536
The longing of my Aktemur.

705
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,394
it hurts my heart mom.

706
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:18,751
Patience girl, patience.

707
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:22,045
Is there any news, Ayşe Hatun?

708
00:57:22,046 --> 00:57:23,496
Is it Dönmez yet?.

709
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:24,757
I'm Dönmez Bala.

710
00:57:25,588 --> 00:57:27,588
He informed me that there is still time.

711
00:57:28,456 --> 00:57:29,513
Donmez.

712
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:33,316
Ten years have passed.

713
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:35,142
We didn't even see his face.

714
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:38,889
Your test was very difficult too, sister.

715
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,135
God give patience.

716
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:41,716
Amen if GOD lets.

717
00:57:43,765 --> 00:57:44,586
Amine.

718
00:57:49,379 --> 00:58:34,102
[Music is playing].

719
00:58:34,652 --> 00:58:35,641
Who is that from?

720
00:58:36,468 --> 00:58:38,075
Orhan and Alaeddin?

721
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:39,844
Hey mom.

722
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:42,967
There is also a girl with them.

[Music is playing].

724
00:58:48,722 --> 00:58:51,869
They say that the fate of Ata comes from the son.

725
00:58:52,775 --> 00:58:55,247
Has Orhan already hunted big game?

726
00:58:55,951 --> 00:58:56,772
either.

727
00:58:56,772 --> 00:59:30,000
[Music is playing].

728
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:30,979
my son.

729
00:59:30,979 --> 00:59:32,243
Are you okay?.

730
00:59:32,243 --> 00:59:33,383
I'm fine mom.

731
00:59:33,954 --> 00:59:34,775
My son.

732
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:36,901
What happened, are you okay?

733
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:41,820
[Music is playing].

734
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,427
Who is our guest?

[Music is playing].

736
00:59:57,351 --> 00:59:58,722
Tell me, son.

737
00:59:58,722 --> 01:00:01,046
Weren't you training with your father?

738
01:00:02,037 --> 01:00:03,015
We went.

739
01:00:03,015 --> 01:00:04,492
but then we went hunting.

740
01:00:05,165 --> 01:00:08,501
We found it chasing soldiers while hunting.

[Music is playing].

742
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,000
We also helped.

01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:21,847
You are welcome, my daughter.

01:26:01,627 --> 01:26:05,395
Our loyalty is to whose table we fill our stomach.

1122
01:26:06,668 --> 01:26:08,384
Tük's fortune is in Barkın Bey.

1123
01:26:09,374 --> 01:26:09,874
Barkin Bey.

1124
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:11,874
We are behind Barkin Bey.

1125
01:26:12,511 --> 01:26:13,592
We are behind Barkin Bey.

1126
01:26:14,581 --> 01:26:15,945
Is there a Destur, sir?

1127
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:16,940
come on.

1128
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:47,099
[Music is playing].

1129
01:26:47,397 --> 01:26:48,232
Well, Mr. Ganja.

1130
01:26:50,212 --> 01:26:51,914
Brother, tell me what you did in your father's home.

1131
01:26:52,782 --> 01:26:56,197
Well, we fired those cruel enemies like brothers and dogs.

1132
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,380
Herds of dogs never expected.

1133
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:04,815
We struggled to the fullest, it didn't turn a blind eye.

1134
01:27:05,168 --> 01:27:06,673
How many innocents have we avenged?

1135
01:27:07,168 --> 01:27:09,026
The oppressors have remembered, brothers.

1136
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,450
If you raise your hand to the oppressed.

1137
01:27:12,653 --> 01:27:13,380
This is what you will see.

1138
01:27:15,502 --> 01:27:17,431
Let your brother hit the wire of the kopuz.

1139
01:27:18,492 --> 01:27:19,148
may our souls rest in peace.

1140
01:27:25,937 --> 01:30:10,578
[Music is playing].

1141
01:30:10,578 --> 01:30:11,517
Hey MashAllah.

1142
01:30:11,871 --> 01:30:12,739
Hey MashAllah Hay.

1143
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:13,890
Hey MashAllah.

1144
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:30,000
Is there a Destur, Osman Bey?

1145
01:30:31,768 --> 01:30:32,990
Come on bro.

1146
01:30:40,629 --> 01:30:41,356
We have no time.

1147
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:44,367
Midnight, if it weren't so important.

1148
01:30:44,367 --> 01:30:45,645
I would not come, Osman Bey.

1149
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:48,636
Nope.

1150
01:30:50,871 --> 01:30:53,205
Tomorrow, the Tekfur of Yarhisar and the Tekfur of Bacak.

1151
01:30:53,205 --> 01:30:54,285
You are invited to your wedding.

1152
01:30:57,256 --> 01:30:57,756
Don't go, huh.

1153
01:30:58,676 --> 01:30:59,434
They set a trap.

1154
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,119
They will kill you.

1155
01:31:08,848 --> 01:31:09,858
Satan.

1156
01:31:13,252 --> 01:31:15,000
I've been helping him all this time.

1157
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,363
How many times have I saved his life?

1158
01:31:19,944 --> 01:31:20,444
But.

1159
01:31:25,884 --> 01:31:26,838
sucked raw milk.

1160
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:29,530
raw.

1161
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:34,821
But the devil has an army.

1162
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,750
we have a friendship like a door.

1163
01:31:42,003 --> 01:31:45,000
May you be there, Kosses, I will not forget this favor.

1164
01:31:45,849 --> 01:31:46,349
Thanks.

1165
01:31:47,778 --> 01:31:48,278
Alright.

1166
01:31:49,905 --> 01:31:50,434
what are you going to do?.

1167
01:31:50,434 --> 01:32:01,777
[Music is playing].

1168
01:32:01,777 --> 01:32:04,696
You left without time, you came without time.

1169
01:32:06,818 --> 01:32:07,527
Bense.

1170
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,718
I slept I just waited.

1171
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:19,964
But no matter what, you still came.

1172
01:32:25,693 --> 01:32:27,198
I keep my word, Barki.

1173
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:36,751
How?.

1174
01:32:37,175 --> 01:32:38,293
Did he say you're leaving, sir?

1175
01:32:38,859 --> 01:32:39,586
I liberated Jerusalem.

1176
01:32:41,001 --> 01:32:42,435
Now it's time to save Rome.

1177
01:32:43,586 --> 01:32:45,000
So how are they there?

1178
01:32:45,778 --> 01:32:46,293
Argun is dead.

1179
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:47,942
Geyhatu took over.

1180
01:32:48,932 --> 01:32:50,225
He is resting in pleasure.

1181
01:32:51,215 --> 01:32:51,942
He has no eyes for war.

1182
01:32:52,974 --> 01:32:54,006
If you are asking about these lands.

1183
01:32:54,884 --> 01:32:56,318
you will help me.

1184
01:32:57,167 --> 01:32:58,601
I can no longer be İbrahim Faki.

1185
01:32:59,576 --> 01:33:00,840
I built that trust very hard.

1186
01:33:02,072 --> 01:33:03,408
Just to destroy Osman.

1187
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:05,252
Tell me what will I do?

1188
01:33:06,257 --> 01:33:07,691
First you will tell me about the tribe.

1189
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:09,535
Who what happened? What did he do?.

1190
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:12,121
What did the past years do to Kayı?

1191
01:33:12,616 --> 01:33:13,262
What did he do?.

1192
01:33:14,535 --> 01:33:15,323
It strengthened.

1193
01:33:16,667 --> 01:33:17,889
Iron from Nikola's mine.

1194
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:19,167
where is it going?.

1195
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:21,738
I've been wondering this for years.

1196
01:33:22,606 --> 01:33:23,106
But I couldn't find it.

1197
01:33:23,672 --> 01:33:24,172
Barkin.

1198
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:26,611
Did the light dazzle you?

1199
01:33:26,611 --> 01:33:27,338
He has blinded you.

1200
01:33:28,753 --> 01:33:31,390
Remember, those in the dark always see.

1201
01:33:34,078 --> 01:33:34,777
What will our move be?

1202
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:37,005
Our move.

1203
01:33:38,703 --> 01:33:39,600
to solve this problem.

1204
01:33:42,217 --> 01:33:45,000
Osman Becek will also be killed at the wedding.

1205
01:33:46,964 --> 01:33:50,025
If Osman is going to be killed, what would you do with the mines?

1206
01:33:50,874 --> 01:33:51,742
Bark for you.

1207
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:53,090
For you.

1208
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:56,781
for the state.

1209
01:33:59,398 --> 01:34:00,432
What will I do?.

1210
01:34:02,413 --> 01:34:02,998
Osman will die.

1211
01:34:04,129 --> 01:34:04,856
Their children will die.

1212
01:34:06,129 --> 01:34:06,926
Kosses will die.

1213
01:34:08,695 --> 01:34:10,424
You will get Söğüt.

1214
01:34:13,749 --> 01:34:16,519
and you will be the sole ruler of the Turks.

1215
01:34:32,998 --> 01:34:34,503
The wedding was set up for us.

1216
01:34:36,503 --> 01:34:37,513
What do you say, sir?

1217
01:34:39,281 --> 01:34:40,229
Is it a trap or not?

1218
01:34:41,927 --> 01:34:43,057
They will try our lives at the wedding.

1219
01:34:44,009 --> 01:34:44,509
but.

1220
01:34:46,054 --> 01:34:47,566
to lure us in.

1221
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,029
They kill Holofira.

1222
01:34:55,475 --> 01:34:55,990
We say wow.

1223
01:34:56,929 --> 01:34:57,868
Waiting all these years.

1224
01:34:58,344 --> 01:35:00,000
Have they decided to attack now, sir?

1225
01:35:03,556 --> 01:35:05,556
What kind of a father is he to such a dirty game.

1226
01:35:05,556 --> 01:35:06,722
does he use his son as a tool?.

1227
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:10,668
Of course, they could not afford openly.

1228
01:35:12,153 --> 01:35:13,799
they've been approaching all these years.

1229
01:35:15,883 --> 01:35:16,977
Just to get behind us, Osman Bey.

1230
01:35:22,352 --> 01:35:23,008
Hey Bey.

1231
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:25,361
You used to say information is everything.

1232
01:35:26,705 --> 01:35:28,139
Then we don't give Holofira.

1233
01:35:29,341 --> 01:35:30,351
We also do not ship the goods.

1234
01:35:31,483 --> 01:35:33,483
At the first opportunity, we will organize expeditions for Becek.

1235
01:35:34,544 --> 01:35:35,087
No.

1236
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:39,479
Now we will give Holofira to her father.

1237
01:35:45,353 --> 01:35:46,222
He's going to the wedding.

1238
01:35:47,747 --> 01:35:48,564
And instead of poison syrup.

1239
01:35:50,293 --> 01:35:51,869
We will drink the sherbet of martyrdom.

1240
01:35:57,598 --> 01:35:58,467
And we'll be giving away wedding presents.

1241
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,680
We'll both take the castle.

1242
01:36:01,952 --> 01:36:03,457
And we'll come back with Holofira.

1243
01:36:16,697 --> 01:36:17,424
That's what I heard.

1244
01:36:18,485 --> 01:36:19,339
war is at the door, Selvi.

1245
01:36:21,815 --> 01:36:22,542
Osman.

1246
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:24,098
ey stuck.

1247
01:36:26,078 --> 01:36:26,578
His too.

1248
01:36:29,237 --> 01:36:31,328
The end of those who are with him is near.

1249
01:36:33,733 --> 01:36:34,672
What is on your mind?.

1250
01:36:35,803 --> 01:36:36,884
What should we do, Barkin?

1251
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:41,277
We consider ourselves.

1252
01:36:43,045 --> 01:36:44,593
We will protect your ancestor's legacy.

1253
01:36:46,593 --> 01:36:49,512
Our heads on the path of Osman Bey will always remain high.

1254
01:36:51,153 --> 01:36:51,951
Not for Osman.

1255
01:36:52,871 --> 01:36:53,654
We will fight for ourselves.

1256
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:54,644
If necessary.

1257
01:36:56,695 --> 01:36:57,969
We will stand in front of Osman.

1258
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,661
What do you say, Barkin? Osman Bey has a lot.

1259
01:37:02,661 --> 01:37:03,954
We've seen the good so far.

1260
01:37:05,615 --> 01:37:06,922
If we live here in peace all this time.

1261
01:37:07,878 --> 01:37:09,171
Osman Bey has a great share in this.

1262
01:37:09,756 --> 01:37:10,256
I am Selvi.

1263
01:37:11,313 --> 01:37:12,888
Osman's only wish was to make us grateful.

1264
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:15,000
We got what we deserve.

1265
01:37:15,707 --> 01:37:16,510
He thinks I'm kind.

1266
01:37:18,631 --> 01:37:20,207
I want to live in peace now, Barkın.

1267
01:37:21,056 --> 01:37:22,349
I don't want separation between us.

1268
01:37:24,349 --> 01:37:25,642
Oh my beautiful girl.

1269
01:37:27,288 --> 01:37:29,430
Osman never saw us himself.

1270
01:37:30,562 --> 01:37:32,067
it rose above us.

1271
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:33,486
Totally enough.

1272
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:36,208
Now it's our turn to ascend.

1273
01:37:39,259 --> 01:37:40,046
Let's talk about that later.

1274
01:37:41,309 --> 01:37:42,390
There is a wedding, let's not be late.

1275
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,046
Come on.

1276
01:37:44,248 --> 01:37:45,000
No, Selvi.

1277
01:37:47,546 --> 01:37:48,641
I won't let you come to the wedding.

1278
01:37:50,905 --> 01:37:51,900
Now I'm going out.

1279
01:37:52,749 --> 01:37:55,117
You should think about what we talked about.

1280
01:37:56,178 --> 01:37:59,098
You should think that your decision is the same as me, Selvi.

1281
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:13,197
Sir, it is dangerous.

1282
01:38:15,197 --> 01:38:15,995
How many people are in the business?

1283
01:38:17,197 --> 01:38:18,560
How many soldiers are waiting for us inside.

1284
01:38:20,257 --> 01:38:21,437
Other Tekfurs invited.

1285
01:38:22,073 --> 01:38:23,720
Otherwise, we have no business, Konur.

1286
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:26,588
If we know the trap.

1287
01:38:28,549 --> 01:38:30,000
then they will be the ones who fall into the trap.

1288
01:38:36,154 --> 01:38:37,895
Of course, he enters with the Alps.

1289
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:41,970
We will crush the castle and the bastard who set the trap.

1290
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:43,970
no.

1291
01:38:44,642 --> 01:38:45,849
If we enter with the Alps.

1292
01:38:47,123 --> 01:38:48,769
then they realize we know the trap.

1293
01:38:53,774 --> 01:38:54,617
You will enter.

1294
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:00,759
We will conquer the castle with Kayı's chicks.

1295
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:04,032
And Bilek Castle will be ours.

1296
01:39:07,144 --> 01:39:10,509
We will distribute the spoils we took from there to the army.

1297
01:39:11,527 --> 01:39:12,263
We will encourage the army.

1298
01:39:13,528 --> 01:39:14,646
We will surround them with puss.

1299
01:39:18,961 --> 01:39:19,461
And.

1300
01:39:20,685 --> 01:39:22,276
with the preparation we have made so far.

1301
01:39:24,186 --> 01:39:25,408
We will march on İnegöl.

1302
01:39:32,334 --> 01:39:34,146
Sisters have been waiting for this day for a long time.

1303
01:39:35,207 --> 01:39:36,810
He drills and waits for gas.

1304
01:39:38,366 --> 01:39:39,517
Thank goodness the time has come.

1305
01:39:41,639 --> 01:39:42,479
Not a single move.

1306
01:39:44,035 --> 01:39:45,000
No wall.

1307
01:39:46,082 --> 01:39:46,834
Nothing is a trap.

1308
01:39:48,037 --> 01:39:49,032
it cannot stand before us.

1309
01:39:53,063 --> 01:39:54,190
It's time for gas.

1310
01:39:55,464 --> 01:39:56,216
Time.

1311
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:58,712
it is the time of conquest.

1312
01:40:01,744 --> 01:40:03,744
[Music is playing].

1313
01:40:03,744 --> 01:41:26,085
[Music is playing].

1314
01:41:26,766 --> 01:41:27,858
God protect me.

1315
01:41:27,858 --> 01:42:10,066
[Music is playing].

1316
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,823
I thought we were friends, Osman Bey.

1317
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:21,895
What makes you think otherwise, Basileus?

1318
01:42:21,895 --> 01:42:22,911
Just say it.

1319
01:42:24,122 --> 01:42:25,365
What you did yesterday.

1320
01:42:28,014 --> 01:42:29,333
You detained my daughter.

1321
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:36,934
You were supposed to send it to me with your commander.

1322
01:42:40,567 --> 01:42:41,962
basileus

1323
01:42:42,945 --> 01:42:45,702
If I could have handed your daughter over to someone other than you.

1324
01:42:47,248 --> 01:42:49,248
then it would have damaged our friendship.

1325
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:53,443
In that case.

1326
01:42:54,957 --> 01:42:59,303
I hope you will honor our friendship.

1327
01:43:00,514 --> 01:43:02,363
I'll take Holofira and go.

1328
01:43:03,044 --> 01:43:42,454
[Music is playing].

1329
01:43:43,287 --> 01:43:44,606
of course.

1330
01:43:46,271 --> 01:43:48,271
Of course, I will give it to you.

1331
01:43:48,725 --> 01:43:52,920
[Music is playing].

1332
01:43:53,374 --> 01:43:54,087
Storm.

1333
01:43:54,087 --> 01:43:54,952
sir.

1334
01:43:57,374 --> 01:43:58,844
Bring Holofira.

1335
01:44:00,466 --> 01:44:01,936
The order is yours, sir.

1336
01:44:02,466 --> 01:44:08,678
[Music is playing].

1337
01:44:08,678 --> 01:44:10,678
Don't be afraid.

1338
01:44:11,662 --> 01:45:18,372
[Music is playing].

1339
01:45:19,659 --> 01:45:24,383
If you come to my daughter's wedding with your whole family.

1340
01:45:25,443 --> 01:45:27,821
You would make me very happy, Osman Bey.

1341
01:45:29,032 --> 01:45:30,000
Please.

1342
01:45:31,362 --> 01:45:33,286
Don't turn down this invitation.

1343
01:45:33,286 --> 01:45:40,019
[Music is playing].

1344
01:45:40,775 --> 01:45:42,472
Thanks.

1345
01:45:43,002 --> 01:45:45,002
Since you invite me to the wedding.

1346
01:45:46,364 --> 01:45:47,153
at that time.

1347
01:45:48,364 --> 01:45:51,272
Of course, it is not possible not to attend the wedding.

1348
01:45:51,272 --> 01:46:46,154
[Music is playing].

1349
01:46:47,214 --> 01:46:49,214
He showed his inner face, Boran.

1350
01:46:50,198 --> 01:46:54,166
It's time to get rid of that dog.

1351
01:46:56,664 --> 01:46:58,891
We will lay those traps on them.

1352
01:47:00,405 --> 01:47:01,800
The order is yours, sir.

1353
01:47:08,763 --> 01:47:11,147
Osman falls victim to the game of Tekfurs.

1354
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:13,147
we will reach our goal.

1355
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,697
Find me such men.

1356
01:47:17,525 --> 01:47:19,374
Let them hold death in their hands.

1357
01:47:20,358 --> 01:47:21,374
It's your command, sir.

1358
01:47:22,282 --> 01:47:25,039
I will not wait, Söğüt will be mine.

1359
01:47:28,218 --> 01:47:29,461
Now go.

1360
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,092
Me too.

1361
01:47:31,092 --> 01:47:33,092
I will find out where the iron from the mines goes.

1362
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:40,238
oh my god.

1363
01:47:41,374 --> 01:47:43,147
The most adept of blacksmith's apprentices.

1364
01:47:47,007 --> 01:47:48,826
Do you know what I called you here?

1365
01:47:54,502 --> 01:47:56,048
You're going to beat me up.

1366
01:47:57,107 --> 01:47:59,107
But only you will hit the hammer.

1367
01:48:02,513 --> 01:48:04,210
Now you listen to me.

1368
01:48:18,666 --> 01:48:20,112
I want to come too.

1369
01:48:20,112 --> 01:48:22,112
I will not put you in a coma on your own.

1370
01:48:23,399 --> 01:48:25,399
But one of us has to stay in the camp, Malhun.

1371
01:48:26,004 --> 01:48:27,550
For our children.

1372
01:48:31,486 --> 01:48:33,486
We also think of our children.

1373
01:48:33,864 --> 01:48:35,637
o Tekfur decay.

1374
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:37,940
Doesn't it hurt the little girl?

1375
01:48:38,394 --> 01:48:41,453
Well, let's know about his father, what about his mother?

1376
01:48:41,453 --> 01:48:43,453
Is his mother alive?

1377
01:48:44,697 --> 01:48:47,454
What mother would use her child for such a dirty job?

1378
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:52,557
We don't know that much.

1379
01:48:54,222 --> 01:48:57,348
Puppy would like to go to Bursa to his aunt.

1380
01:48:59,348 --> 01:49:01,348
Well said, Bala Ana.

1381
01:49:01,726 --> 01:49:04,029
All she wanted was to get to her aunt safely.

1382
01:49:04,483 --> 01:49:05,650
I'm Orhan.

1383
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,953
But circumstances prevented this.

1384
01:49:10,331 --> 01:49:13,239
Besides, your father did his best, you know.

1385
01:49:14,677 --> 01:49:16,677
I promised your father not to chase you.

1386
01:49:17,964 --> 01:49:19,888
Did this happen now, Mother Bala?.

1387
01:49:26,927 --> 01:49:29,532
My soft hearted son.

1388
01:49:30,365 --> 01:49:31,305
I'm Orhan.

1389
01:49:32,213 --> 01:49:34,213
Your father made the right decision.

1390
01:49:34,970 --> 01:49:37,121
Maybe he also knows something.

1391
01:49:38,667 --> 01:49:40,667
It doesn't suit us to talk otherwise.

1392
01:49:41,197 --> 01:50:04,563
[Music is playing].

1393
01:50:05,774 --> 01:50:07,169
Orhan Brother.

1394
01:50:13,375 --> 01:50:14,466
Orhan Brother, .

1395
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,243
My sheikh grandfather waits.

1396
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:18,243
We have instruction in the dervish lodge.

1397
01:50:18,243 --> 01:50:19,486
We will be late.

1398
01:50:22,059 --> 01:50:22,924
orhan.

1399
01:50:23,302 --> 01:50:24,167
Aladdin.

1400
01:50:33,098 --> 01:50:34,802
Get your money.

1401
01:50:35,105 --> 01:50:36,878
We go to the shop.

1402
01:50:38,089 --> 01:50:38,589
Lets.

1403
01:50:54,407 --> 01:51:02,027
[Music is playing].

1404
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:03,498
Here it is.

1405
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:05,800
It is in Bilecik.

1406
01:51:07,011 --> 01:51:09,011
We do this all over again every time we arrive.

1407
01:51:11,509 --> 01:51:13,282
If they set a trap for us.

1408
01:51:13,963 --> 01:51:15,963
Then we will take our precautions.

1409
01:51:18,461 --> 01:51:20,461
When we are in the hall with Turgut Bey.

1410
01:51:21,369 --> 01:51:22,460
you.

1411
01:51:22,763 --> 01:51:24,687
You will spread out.

1412
01:51:26,276 --> 01:51:26,914
Storm.

1413
01:51:26,914 --> 01:51:27,552
sir.

1414
01:51:27,552 --> 01:51:28,052
It is put.

1415
01:51:28,355 --> 01:51:31,188
You will not leave the side of the commanders of the Tekfur.

1416
01:51:32,172 --> 01:51:33,491
On his first moves.

1417
01:51:33,869 --> 01:51:35,869
You will kill them without orders.

1418
01:51:36,702 --> 01:51:37,718
The order is yours, sir.

1419
01:51:39,415 --> 01:51:40,961
Oh, be careful.

1420
01:51:40,961 --> 01:51:43,037
These heartless people don't always attack with a clown.

1421
01:51:43,491 --> 01:51:44,356
The moment comes.

1422
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,037
They also use poison without hesitation.

1423
01:51:47,037 --> 01:51:47,750
That's right.

1424
01:51:48,053 --> 01:51:48,993
Shamil,.

1425
01:51:49,598 --> 01:51:51,598
Did you bring the antidote that Brown Abdal gave you?

1426
01:51:51,976 --> 01:51:53,068
I brought it, Mr.

1427
01:51:53,749 --> 01:51:54,311
Thanks.

1428
01:51:54,311 --> 01:51:56,311
Every precaution has been taken into account.

1429
01:51:56,311 --> 01:51:57,630
God first.

1430
01:51:57,630 --> 01:51:58,646
Thanks.

1431
01:51:58,646 --> 01:51:59,511
Mr. Ganja.

1432
01:51:59,511 --> 01:52:00,678
Here you go, sir.

1433
01:52:00,678 --> 01:52:01,467
Turan.

1434
01:52:03,056 --> 01:52:05,510
The secret passage from Rogatus still functions.

1435
01:52:06,570 --> 01:52:08,570
You will bring the rest of the horses from there.

1436
01:52:08,948 --> 01:52:10,570
It's your command, sir.

1437
01:52:11,478 --> 01:52:13,478
The sisters will come in with the goods.

1438
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:16,570
We're going with the wedding too.

Ayy Mashallah.

Hey Mashallah my valiants.

1443
01:53:25,326 --> 01:53:26,191
Let's see.

1444
01:53:26,191 --> 01:53:29,024
You should take what my sheikh has finished to the oven.

1445
01:53:31,024 --> 01:53:34,916
Alaeddin, you should pour water, my son.

1446
01:53:36,127 --> 01:53:37,749
Come on, let's.

1447

Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

1448

It is enough, it is enough. Thank you.

1449
01:53:54,993 --> 01:53:58,328
Grandpa, you get tired, you're covered in sweat.

1450
01:53:58,706 --> 01:54:00,933
Wouldn't it be better to leave it to the apprentices?

1451
01:54:01,387 --> 01:54:03,917
There is no mercy without effort, son.

1452
01:54:04,825 --> 01:54:06,598
Said Sheikh.

1453
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:10,112
Is the bed worthy of us?

1454

As long as I have the .

1455

The work we do.

1458
01:54:30,462 --> 01:54:32,765
Do not underestimate, princes.

1459
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:34,765
Estagfurullah Pirim.

1460
01:54:41,274 --> 01:54:43,728
Do you know who is a righteous Muslim?

1461
01:54:44,697 --> 01:54:46,470
We wish to learn, my Sheikh.

1462
01:54:51,541 --> 01:54:52,911
Come on that time.

1463
01:54:53,289 --> 01:54:54,986
Leave it to me, my Sheikh.

1464
01:54:56,651 --> 01:54:58,651
Thank you, Akcam.

1465
01:55:01,451 --> 01:55:04,497
Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.

1466
01:55:07,146 --> 01:55:08,995
You just sit down.

1467
01:55:21,710 --> 01:55:23,559
Salih Muslim.

humans, plants, animals, .

1471
01:55:36,371 --> 01:55:42,306
It is to be instrumental in good works that will be a cure.

1472
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,533
falling on me.

1473
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,546
is to do the test.

1474
01:55:47,606 --> 01:55:49,606
It's making pottery.

1475
01:55:51,606 --> 01:55:53,606
In the ladies' hearth.

1476
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:55,649
if it cooks well.

happiness comes.

1479
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,773
From that pot.

1480
01:56:02,454 --> 01:56:06,422
to the puppies that eat banners.

1481
01:56:07,103 --> 01:56:08,497
power comes.

1482

If, .

If he betrays the meal, .

1485
01:56:18,324 --> 01:56:22,292
It causes trouble for our sister who cooks.

1486
01:56:23,427 --> 01:56:27,774
If he embarrasses her with his erine.

1487
01:56:28,456 --> 01:56:30,456
wow me.

1488
01:56:30,834 --> 01:56:32,834
Hey, my princes.

1490
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:40,542
I work the pots with this love.

1491
01:56:41,147 --> 01:56:45,000
With that spirit, I am busy with my work at this age.

1492

Always.

1496
01:56:55,985 --> 01:56:57,985
Remember, my children.

1497
01:56:57,985 --> 01:57:01,272
what a man's job is.

1498
01:57:01,802 --> 01:57:03,802
so is faith.

1499
01:57:04,407 --> 01:57:06,407
The one who is not good at work.

1500
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:10,829
the man who cheated on his job, .

1501
01:57:11,889 --> 01:57:13,586
oh my god.

1502
01:57:14,343 --> 01:57:15,965
oh my god.

1503
01:57:19,068 --> 01:57:22,809
his faith is on the paper clip line.

1504
01:57:23,263 --> 01:57:25,263
You be you.

1505
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:28,020
Don't cheat on your business.

1506
01:57:34,983 --> 01:57:38,007
What did I just tell you?

1507
01:57:38,385 --> 01:57:40,385
A Muslim cannot lie down, my Sheikh.

1508
01:57:43,337 --> 01:57:45,337
It should always be at work.

1509
01:57:49,575 --> 01:57:50,440
Come on bro.

1510
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:51,380
Come on, my guard.

Peace that lasted for years, .

1519
01:58:47,084 --> 01:58:48,781
will come to an end.

1520
01:58:49,992 --> 01:58:53,355
But this end is a new beginning.

1521
01:58:54,868 --> 01:58:56,868
It is a time of conquest.

1523
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:01,549
hopefully.

They exist as much as you mentioned, Nikola.

1534

Osman, Turgut, Gündüz all and all, .

1535
01:59:36,545 --> 01:59:39,983
All of them will be shot by these snipers.

1536
01:59:40,361 --> 01:59:43,032
I've been laughing in Osman's face for years.

1537
01:59:43,032 --> 01:59:44,502
Very annoying Nikola.

1538
01:59:44,502 --> 01:59:46,350
Apart from his camp, his alps; .

1539
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:47,745
including their women, children, .

1540

the young, the old.

1541
01:59:49,064 --> 01:59:51,518
We will destroy them all, all of them.

Obviously, someone had their dog after us.

1546

Let's not show that they are stones, now he wouldn't know.

Let's continue on our way like ….

Ahh.

1551
02:00:46,025 --> 02:00:47,909
Protect the children of the Alps.

1552
02:00:49,245 --> 02:00:52,378
Do not be afraid, my brother, we will reach the camp safely.

1553
02:00:52,378 --> 02:00:54,098
I'm not afraid when you're behind me, brother.

1554
02:01:03,334 --> 02:01:05,929
We did not waste all your training, now your skills.

Osman's weak lights, I have come to extinguish you.

1560
02:01:58,831 --> 02:01:59,331
Stop.

1561
02:02:02,777 --> 02:02:06,773
Let go of your sword or you will watch your brother die.

Who are you?.

1563

Leave.

Get these.

How nice of you to come to greet us, Bedros.

1571

You are so elegant.

1572

Obviously not to comrade you, but out of your way.

1573
02:03:05,946 --> 02:03:07,011
I came to do it.

1574
02:03:09,483 --> 02:03:10,470
Is that so?.

1575
02:03:11,602 --> 02:03:12,735
Welcome.

1577
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,534
You continued to be with Osman again.

1578
02:03:20,238 --> 02:03:21,084
When it's so different.

1579
02:03:21,084 --> 02:03:24,202

1580
02:03:24,624 --> 02:03:26,389
